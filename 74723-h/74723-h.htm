  <p>Though Magellan’s enterprise was the greatest ever undertaken by
    any navigator, yet he has been deprived of his due fame by the
    jealousy which has always existed between the two nations inhabiting
    the Peninsula: the Spaniards would not brook being commanded by a
    Portuguese, and the Portuguese have not yet forgiven Magellan for
    having abandoned them to serve Castile. But Magellan really had no
    choice; for if the western passage which he expected to discover was
    to be sought for, it could only be under the auspices of Spain, within
    whose demarcation those waters lay.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">ii</span>It would seem that D. Manuel had
    only himself to blame for the loss of Magellan’s services; and, as M.
    Amoretti well observes, D. Manuel ought to have been well aware of
    the value of those services, since Charles V knew it, and showed his
    appreciation of them. It is difficult to believe that the injury of
    which Magellan complained, and which led him to seek other service, was
    merely, as Osorio says, the refusal of promotion in palace rank, and
    which he had well deserved, especially since the motive ascribed by
    Osorio to the king’s refusal, namely the necessity of avoiding a bad
    precedent, was not alone a sufficient affront to account for Magellan’s
    sacrificing all his hopes and property in his own country, had he not
    also felt that the king was condemning him to inaction, obscurity, and
    uselessness. Barros, indeed, says that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The favours of princes given for services are a retributive
      justice, which must be observed equally with all, with regard
      to the quality of each man: and that if a man’s portion
      be denied him, though he endures it ill, yet he will have
      patience; but if he see the advancement of those who have
      profited more by artifice and friends than by their own merits,
      he loses all patience; indignation, hatred, and despair arise,
      and he will commit faults injurious to himself and others. And
      what outraged Magellan more than the refusal of the half ducat
      a month, was that some men who were with him at Azamor, said
      that his lameness was feigned to support his petition.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">The king, moreover, refused to receive Magellan, and showed his
    ill-will against him. It is therefore highly probable that before
    Magellan took the step of leaving Portugal, D. Manuel, prompted by his
    niggardly disposition, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">iii</span>had refused to entertain Magellan’s desire
    for employment at sea, or his projects of discovery, from which
    no immediate profit was to be expected. This is apparent from the
    statement of Barros, <i>Decad.</i> <span class="smcap">iii</span>, lib. v, cap. viii,
    that letters of Magellan to Francisco Serrano were found after the
    death of the latter in Maluco, in which Magellan said that he should
    soon see him; and, if it were not by way of Portugal, it would be by
    way of Castile, and that Serrano should therefore wait for him there.
    Further on, Barros says that recourse to Castile appears from these
    letters to have been in Magellan’s mind some time before the occurrence
    of the king’s dismissal of his business: and that this was shown by his
    always associating with pilots, and occupying himself with sea-charts.</p>

  <p>The Portuguese exaggerated very much the injury they expected to
    result, and, later, which they thought had resulted from Magellan’s
    voyage, which could not change the position of the Moluccas, nor
    consequently the Portuguese title to them; but the apprehensions
    which they felt, arose from their fear of others sharing in the spice
    trade, and from the limited geographical knowledge of the period,
    which left both parties very much in doubt as to the true position of
    those islands, or as to the extent of the circumference of the globe.
    The question of the exact position of the Moluccas was not definitely
    ascertained till much later, though a compromise was arrived at in 1529
    by the treaty between Spain and Portugal, by which Charles V gave up
    whatever rights to the Moluccas he imagined he possessed, to Portugal,
    for a sum of three hundred and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>fifty thousand ducats.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As late as
    1535, Gaspar Correa mentions, tom. iii, p. 661, a Dominican friar in
    Portuguese India, who was learned in cosmography, and who asserted that
    the Moluccas fell within the demarcation of Castile.</p>

  <p>The grounds of complaint of the Portuguese against Magellan are,
    perhaps, best expressed, and in the strongest terms, by Bishop Osorio,
    so it may be well to quote from him the following passage. Lib.
    <span class="smcap">xi</span>, § 23.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“About this time a slight offence on the part of the king
      (D. Manuel) so grievously exasperated the mind of a certain
      Portuguese, that, forgetful of all faith, piety, and religion,
      he hastened to betray the king who had educated him, and the
      country which had brought him forth; and he risked his life
      amongst the greatest perils. Ferdinand Magellan, of whom we
      have before spoken, was a man of noble birth, and endued with a
      high spirit. He had given proofs in India, in warlike affairs,
      of courage and perseverance in no small degree. Likewise in
      Africa he had performed his duties with great ardour. Formerly
      it was the custom among the Portuguese that the king’s servants
      should be fed in the palace at the king’s expense; but when
      the number of these servants had become so great (because the
      sons of the king’s officers retained the same station, and
      besides, many were admitted for their services into the king’s
      household), it was seen to be very difficult to prepare the
      food of such a multitude. On this account it was determined
      by the Kings of Portugal that the food which each man was to
      receive in the palace should be provided by himself out of the
      king’s money. Thus it was settled that a certain sum of money
      was assigned per month to each man. That money, indeed, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>when
      provisions were so cheap, provided abundantly for the men;
      but now that the number of men, and the prices of commodities
      had increased, it happened that the sum, which formerly was
      more than sufficient for their daily expenses, was now much
      too small. Moreover, as all the dignity of the Portuguese
      depends upon the king, this small sum of money is as eagerly
      sought after as though it were much more ample. And as the
      Portuguese think that the thing most to be desired is to be
      enrolled amongst the king’s household, so also, they consider
      the greatest honour to consist in an increase of this stipend.
      For, as there are various ranks of king’s servants, so the sum
      of money is assigned to each servant according to the dignity
      of his rank. The highest class is that of nobleman; but, as
      there are distinctions of nobility, so an equal salary is not
      given to all. Thus it happens that the nobility of each is
      estimated according to the importance of this stipend, and
      each one is held to be more noble in proportion to the more
      ample stipend which he receives. This judgment, indeed, as
      human affairs go, is often most false; for many obtain through
      ambition and pertinacity what ought to be assigned to deserts
      and innate nobleness. The Portuguese, however, since they
      are over anxious in seeking this nobility, and imagine that
      their nobility is increased by a small accession of salary,
      very often think that they must strive for this little sum of
      money, as though all their well-being and dignity depended
      upon it. Now, Magellan contended that for his services, his
      stipend should be increased monthly by half a ducat. The king
      refused it him, lest an entrance should be opened to ambitious
      persons. Magellan, excited by the injury of the refusal of this
      advantage to him at that time, abandoned the king, broke his
      faith, and brought the State into extreme danger. And whilst we
      ought to tolerate the injuries inflicted by the State, and to
      endure also the outrages of kings, who are the fathers of the
      republick, and whilst we ought to lay down our lives for the
      well-being of our country, which lives we owe to our country;
      this most <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>audacious man conceived such despite on account of
      half a ducat, amounting to five denarii, which was refused to
      him, that he opposed the State; he offended the king, who had
      brought him up; and brought his country, for which he should
      have died, into peril. For the affair reached such a pitch that
      the danger of a perilous war impended over the commonwealth.
      I do not know, indeed, whence so barbarous a custom has crept
      into the State: for, whilst the name of a traitor is not only
      hateful and hated, but also burns in the stain of everlasting
      dishonour upon a whole posterity; yet men who determine upon
      breaking their faith, and opposing their kings or states, may
      reject the favours they have received by formal letters, may
      abjure their fealty, and despoil themselves of the rights
      and duties of the State; they bid the king keep for himself
      that which belongs to him, and they attest that thenceforward
      they will have nothing in common with their country: then, at
      length, they contend that it is allowable for them to commence
      war against their country. Be it so: reject favours if it
      please you; contemn the liberality of your country; grumble
      as much as you please, that a reward equal to your dignity
      has not been granted. But by what means can you betray the
      faith which you have plighted? My country has inflicted on me
      a severe outrage; it has inflicted, indeed, the worst. But an
      outrage is not to be avenged, either upon parents or upon one’s
      country. I have abandoned, he says, all that I had received
      from my country. Have you then rejected life, disposition, and
      education? By no means. But all these things; you received
      them, in the first place, from God, and then from the laws,
      customs, and institutions of your country. It will never be
      allowable to combat nature, to injure your country, or to
      break faith, even should you be laden with every injury. Nay,
      your life should be given up, and the most extreme punishments
      should be undergone, sooner than break your faith, or betray
      your duty. Abjure fealty as much as you please, attest your
      perfidy by public letters, leave to posterity a notable memory
      of unspeakable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>wickedness; yet you will not be able by any
      such document to avoid offending the Deity, nor the stain of an
      everlasting opprobrium.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Against this view of Osorio may be set the following passage from
    Vattel, which has all the more weight, in that it is simply an
    enunciation of law and right, and is not written to support or to
    denounce any particular person.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Many distinctions will be necessary, in order to give a
      complete solution to the celebrated question, whether a man
      may <em>quit his country</em>, or <em>the society of which he is
      a member</em>. The children are bound by natural ties to the
      society in which they were born; they are under an obligation
      to shew themselves grateful for the protection it has afforded
      to their fathers, and are in a great measure indebted to it
      for their birth and education. They ought, therefore, to love
      it, as we have already shewn, to express a just gratitude to
      it, and requite its services as far as possible by serving it
      in turn. We have observed above, that they have a right to
      enter into the society of which their fathers were members. But
      every man is born free; and the son of a citizen, when come to
      the years of discretion, may examine whether it be convenient
      for him to join the society for which he was destined by his
      birth. If he does not find it advantageous to remain in it,
      he is at liberty to quit it, on making it a compensation for
      what it has done in his favour, and preserving, as far as his
      new engagements will allow him, the sentiments of love and
      gratitude he owes it.”—<cite>Chitty’s translation of Vattel</cite>,
      book <span class="smcap">i</span>, cap. xix, § 220.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are also some remarkable passages in a pamphlet by Condorcet,
    dated October 25th, 1791, named <cite>Opinion sur les Emigrants</cite>. This
    opinion deserves attention, both on account of its author and the time
    in which it was written, when popular passions and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>prejudices were
    much excited against those who were expatriating themselves from France.</p>

  <p>Condorcet begins with the statement, that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It is a great error to imagine that the public utility is not
      constantly to be found united with the rights of individuals,
      or that the public well-being may demand acts of real
      injustice. This error has everywhere been the eternal excuse
      for the inroads of tyranny, and the pretext for the artful
      manœuvres employed to establish it.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>”</p>

    <p>“On the contrary, in the case of every measure that is proposed
      as useful, it must first be examined whether it is just. Should
      it not be so, it must be concluded that it had only an empty
      and fallacious appearance of utility.”</p>

    <div class="center">•<span class="col3">•</span>
      <span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span></div>

    <p>“Nature concedes to every man the right of going out of his
      country; the constitution guarantees it to every French
      citizen, and we cannot strike a blow at it. The Frenchman who
      wishes to leave his country, for his business, for his health,
      even for the sake of his peace and well-being, ought to have
      the fullest liberty to do so: he ought to be able to use this
      liberty, without his absence depriving him of the least of his
      rights. In a great empire, the variety of professions, and
      inequality of fortunes, do not admit of residence and personal
      service being regarded as a common obligation which the law may
      impose upon all citizens. This rigorous obligation can only
      exist in the case of absolute necessity; to extend it to the
      habitual state of society, and even to all periods when the
      public safety or tranquillity may seem to be menaced, would
      be to disturb the order of useful labours, and to attack the
      sources of general prosperity.”</p>

    <p>“Every man, moreover, has the right to change his country; he
      may renounce that in which he was born, to choose <span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>another.
      From that moment, as a citizen of his new country, he is only
      a foreigner in the first; but if some day he returns to it, if
      he has left any property in it, he ought to enjoy there to the
      full the rights of man; he has only deserved to lose those of a
      citizen.”</p>

    <p>“But here a first question presents itself. Is this citizen by
      his sole renunciation released from every obligation towards
      the body politic which he abandons? Does the society from which
      he separates himself lose immediately all its rights over him?
      Doubtless, not; and I do not speak only of those sentiments
      which a noble and grateful soul preserves for its country, even
      though it be unjust; I speak of rigorous obligations, of those
      which a man cannot fail to fulfil without becoming guilty of an
      offence: and I say that there exists a time during which a man
      placed between his ancient and his new country can only permit
      himself to express hopes as to the differences which arise
      between them: a time when that one of the two nations against
      which he might bear arms would have the right to punish him
      as an assassin; and when the man who might employ his riches
      or talents against his former countrymen, would really be a
      traitor.”</p>

    <p>“I will add that each nation has also the right to fix the time
      after which the citizen who abandons it is to be considered
      as free from all obligation, and to determine what are his
      duties until the expiration of that period, and what actions
      it still preserves the power to forbid him. To deny this
      principle, would be to break all the social bonds which can
      bind men together. This period, doubtless, is not an arbitrary
      one; it is that during which the citizen who abdicates can
      employ against his country the means which he has received from
      it, and during which he can do it more injury than could a
      foreigner.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Further on, Condorcet proposes two years as the period during which
    a citizen who renounces his nationality shall engage not to enter
    the service of any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>foreign power, unless he has been authorised so
    to do by a decree of the national assembly. He also proposes various
    measures for different classes of emigrants, and the full enjoyment of
    their property on the same footing as foreigners, by those who sign an
    engagement not to take foreign service for two years, nor during that
    time to solicit the aid of any foreign power against the nation or its
    constituted authorities.</p>

  <p>Magellan fully satisfied the conditions specified by Vattel, as may
    be seen by his conversations with Sebastian Alvarez, the King of
    Portugal’s agent: at this date, also, it is sufficiently clear that
    Magellan not only did no harm to his native country, but that he
    increased its renown by his own services, and by those of the other
    Portuguese officers whom he associated with his labours. If his
    countrymen have preferred Gama to him, it is because he only served
    the interests of science, whilst Gama served the passions of his
    countrymen, and aided them to enrich themselves. After D. Manuel had
    refused employment and advancement to Magellan, and seemed inclined
    to leave him in the obscurity of a small garrison in Africa, the
    Portuguese would seem to have no more right to complain of Magellan’s
    profiting by the opportunities offered by Spain, than the Genoese
    would have had, if they had reproached Columbus for availing himself
    in a similar way of the resources of that country. D. Manuel, it is
    true, made offers to Magellan if he would leave Spain and return to
    Portugal, but it was then too late, for the great navigator had already
    pledged his word to Charles V.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>There is another circumstance which
    justifies Magellan still more than if he had been an Englishman or
    a Frenchman, a circumstance peculiar to Spain and Portugal. In the
    Peninsula, the kingly power was of recent origin, and had been divided
    amongst several crowns: the wearers of these crowns had been at first
    only the equals of other great lords, and, after they had acquired
    these crowns, they were only the first amongst their equals; and such
    they recognised themselves to be by their coronation oaths, even long
    after the time of Magellan. In these coronation oaths they also bound
    themselves more than did other European sovereigns to respect all the
    privileges of the great nobles; any infraction of which was held to
    justify these in revolt from the sovereign. At the same time there
    existed the custom and tradition of disnaturalisation, in accordance
    with which any noble who felt aggrieved, formally renounced his fealty
    to the sovereign, and betook himself to some neighbouring state. Osorio
    and Mariana, who wrote when the kingly power had become consolidated,
    ridicule this custom; but it must have had the advantage of giving time
    and opportunity for a peaceable settlement instead of an immediate
    recourse to arms. But whether the custom was good or bad, there is no
    doubt that it was generally and constantly acted upon; and Magellan was
    following precedents that were generally received in the Peninsula.
    It is unfortunate that the document mentioned by historians, by which
    Magellan formally renounced fealty to D. Manuel, is not forthcoming in
    the archives either of Spain or Portugal; but it may <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>be supposed to be
    similar in substance to those renunciations which Osorio mentions and
    reproves.</p>

  <p>Among those who disnaturalised themselves may be cited various Condes
    de Haro of Biscay, and Guzman, who gave his services to Marocco,
    and who bears the title of El Bueno. With regard to Count Diego de
    Haro, who in 1216 withdrew from Castile to Navarre, Mariana makes the
    following observations.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Several great lords of Castile, irritated against their king,
      whose avarice they could not endure, had passed into the
      kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon, after having renounced their
      right of naturalisation by a public deed, a means formerly
      in use amongst those nations, in order not to be regarded as
      traitors and rebels when they quitted the states of their
      sovereign.... Among the grandees who came to take refuge in
      Navarre, the most illustrious beyond dispute was Don Diego
      de Haro. This lord had excellent qualities: never were seen
      greater constancy, probity, or zeal for the public service than
      his; the slightest injustice irritated him. It was in order not
      to see his country and freedom oppressed, that he abandoned
      Castile.”—<cite>Mariana, History of Spain</cite>, book <span class="smcap">xiii</span>.</p>

    <p>“In the year 1276, Alfonso the Wise had defeated Yussuf, the
      Emperor of Marocco, and made peace with him with the assistance
      of Guzman: a tournament was held in Seville in celebration of
      it, and King Alfonso having asked who had most distinguished
      himself, was told D. Alonzo Perez. He asked which of them, and
      D. Juan Ramirez de Guzman replied: ‘Alonzo Perez de Guzman,
      my brother of profit.’ This answer seemed ill to all, and
      especially to Guzman, who saw that a slur was cast upon the
      illegitimacy of his birth, for at that time they named children
      of profit (<i>gananciu</i>), those who were born of unmarried
      women, and his mother had not been married. Guzman, irritated
      at being thus spoken of before the king and the court, then
      said: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>‘You speak truth, I am a brother of profit, but you
      are and will be one of loss; and were it not for the respect
      due to the presence in which we stand, I would teach you the
      manner in which you should treat me; but you are not to blame
      for it, but rather he who has brought you up and taught you
      so ill.’ The king, against whom this complaint appeared to be
      directed, then said: ‘Your brother does not speak ill, for so
      it is the custom in Castile to name those who are not children
      of women married to their husbands.’ ‘So also,’ he replied,
      ‘is it the custom of the nobles of Castile, when they are not
      well treated by their sovereigns, to go abroad to seek those
      who will treat them well; I will do likewise; and I swear not
      to return until with truth they may call me a man of profit.
      Grant me, therefore, the term which the privilege of the nobles
      of Castile gives, that I may go out of the kingdom, for from
      this day I disnaturalise myself, and take leave of being your
      vassal.’ The king attempted to dissuade him, but his efforts
      being in vain, he had to grant him the term which he asked

  <p>There seems to be some inconsistency on the part of those who refuse
    to admit of disnaturalisation, yet at the same time maintain that
    rebellion can be justified. If there is a justification of rebellion,
    the right of expatriation, or of withdrawal from amongst those
    who provoke rebellion, must exist; and there can be no doubt that
    the peaceable withdrawal of those who are oppressed or injured is
    preferable in the interests of all to armed insurrection. Even Bishop
    Osorio and Mariana would probably admit that the disnaturalisation of
    Prim and Serrano would have been better than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>their treason, which has
    plunged Spain in anarchy and bloodshed for so many years.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Rebellions
    have almost always been conducted by minorities; and as their
    justification does not depend upon the numerical importance of those
    engaged in them, it would follow that in the case of disnaturalisation,
    where numbers are not requisite, as in the case of armed insurrection,
    the right would exist equally even if the minority consisted only of
    one.</p>

  <p>There are some writers on the Law of Nations, with whom I am agreed in
    general, who disapprove of the Naturalisation and Disnaturalisation
    Act of the Session of 1869. I am compelled to differ from them with
    respect to that measure, for the foregoing reasons, and also because
    it seems to me that they have lost sight of another circumstance
    which affects the question. So long as kingly power was a reality,
    personal allegiance and duty to the sovereign was a reality also.
    But now that modern innovation and corruption have substituted the
    rule of majorities for the kingly power, the feeling of the personal
    duty of the subject is almost lost; and the subject, or citizen, has
    become only one of an aggregation of individuals, or of an association
    of persons with equal rights; and each member of such an association
    has clearly the right to choose whether he will form part of it or
    not: so that whatever rights of expatriation may have existed in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>the
    times of Magellan, Grotius, and Vattel, have become much stronger at
    the present time, when the conscience of the subject is no longer
    considered by some as held bound by duty to the sovereign, who has
    become almost impersonal: instead of loyalty and fealty, we have the
    duty of fair dealing as between partners and associates on equal terms,
    as is exemplified by the argumentation of Condorcet in the passage
    quoted above. That this view is in accordance with the common sense
    and consent of mankind is shown by the general repudiation of the
    pretension of the northern portion of the United States to term the
    secession of the southern states a rebellion; and this pretension was
    seen to be especially illogical on the part of those who had repudiated
    the name of rebels when they departed from the duty of obedience to
    their lawful sovereign.</p>

  <p>Magellan has not had the good fortune of Vasco da Gama, whose exploits
    have been narrated by Camoens and Gaspar Correa; he did not survive
    to give his own account of his great voyage, and the only accounts
    preserved were written by two Italians of very small literary capacity.
    There are, however, more documents concerning Magellan in existence
    than are to be found with respect to Gama.</p>

  <p>The birth-place of Magellan is doubtful; according to his will executed
    in Lisbon, December 29th, 1504, in favour of his sister, Theresa de
    Magalhāes, wife of Joan da Sylva Telles, he was born at Villa de
    Sabroza, in the district of Villa Real, Traz os Montes; in his will of
    August 24th, 1519, he calls himself “Vezino de <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>Porto,” or domiciled at
    Porto; documents quoted by M. Ferdinand Denis make him to be born at
    Villa de Figueiro in Portuguese Estremadura. His family was “hidalgo,”
    with a known coat of arms, of which a plate is given in this volume.</p>

  <p>The book of noble genealogies of Portugal, by Bernardo Pimenta do
    Avelar Portocarrero, states, in the vol. M, done and copied in the year
    1721, fo. 641, that Ruy de Magalhaēs, whose parents are unknown, was
    Alcaide-mōr of Aveiro. He married Alda de Mesquita, daughter of Martin
    Gonzalves Pimentel and Ignez de Mesquita. Antonio de Lima (another
    genealogist) represents her as the wife of Gil de Magalhaēs, fifth son
    of Gil de Magalhaēs; and he gives her the same children as others give
    to Ruy de Magalhaēs: who had</p>

  <p>Genebra de Magalhaēs, wife of Pero Cāo.</p>

  <p>Fernāo de Magalhaēs, who married Da. Brites Barbosa, daughter of his
    relation Diogo Barbosa, alcaidemōr of Seville, in the absence of D.
    Alvaro of Portugal; he had</p>

  <p>Da. Anna de Magalhaēs, his heiress, the wife of D. Hernando de Henao e
    Avila, from whom his lineage continues. She was his only child.</p>

  <p>This does not agree with the archives of Seville, from which it appears
    that Beatriz Barbosa was daughter of Diego Barbosa and Maria Caldera,
    and that Fernan Magalhaēs and Beatriz Barbosa had a son named Rodrigo;
    and that after the death of these three, Diego Barbosa became their
    heir; and he having died in 1525, his son Jayme inherited.</p>

  <p>Fernan Magellan executed a will in Seville on the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>24th day of August,
    1519. He instituted by it a mayorazgo for his son, grandson, or
    relation, who should bear the name of Magallanes, and who should be
    bound to live in the kingdoms of Castille. He also bequeathed a sum of
    12,500 maravedis to the Convent of N. S. de la Victoria in Triana.</p>

  <p>Two facsimiles of the signature of Magellan are given, one taken from
    his signature to the protocol of the Council of War, held at Cochim in
    1510; there is also a facsimile of the signature of another Magellan,
    taken from the book of Moradias or Palace stipends, attached to a
    receipt printed by Navarrete, who appears to have supposed it to
    have been that of the navigator: and a facsimile of the signature of
    Magellan’s brother-in-law Duarte Barbosa.</p>

  <p>Gaspar Correa states, in his <cite>Lendas da India</cite>, tom. <span class="smcap">ii</span>,
    p. 28, that, in January of 1510, Alfonso d’Alboquerque despatched the
    ships from Cochim to the kingdom.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Two ships of Bastian de Sousa and Francisco de Sá convoyed
      this fleet, and at night they both struck on the shoals of
      Padua, which are opposite the Maldive Islands, and remained
      aground, upright, and without breaking up. Upon this they
      prepared the boats as well as they could, and raised their
      sides, and put inside water and biscuit, and victuals which
      did not require cooking. The captains and pilots, and as many
      men as could, got into these boats and returned to Cochym. The
      people who remained in the ships set shores&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> on each side
      of the ships, with the yards, which they cut. All this was
      arranged and commanded by an honourable gentleman, who remained
      as overseer, named Fernan de Magalhaēs, who had been much
      wounded in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>Calecut. He took much care that the chests should
      not be broken, and that there should be no robbery, because
      the captains were going to request ships of the governor, with
      which to return to the ships to save what goods had not been
      wetted. These captains reached Cananor in eight days, from
      whence they sent a message to the governor, who at once sent
      Gonzalo de Crasto in a caravel, with two pilots; and they went
      to the ships and put the best things on board the caravel,
      until they could not load it any more, and having recovered
      all the men, they set fire to the ships, as they were already
      full of water. So they returned to Cochim. In this Fernan de
      Magalhāes worked hard, and did much service, and attended well
      to everything.”</p>

    <p>“This Fernan de Magalhāes was of the king’s household, and came
      to India with the Viceroy Dom Francisco [d’Almeida], and he was
      in the action with the Turks; and he was always much wounded in
      the fleets and in Calecut; and in these ships he lost his small
      portion of property,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and he went away poor to Portugal, and
      went about with claims for his services, and begged of the king
      a hundred reis increase of his palace stipend,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which the
      king did not choose to grant, at which he was aggrieved, and
      went to Castile to live at Seville, where he married. As he had
      much knowledge of the art of navigation, and enterprise, and
      devoted himself to that, he came to an understanding with the
      directors of the House of Trade of Seville, so that the emperor
      gave him a fleet of five ships, with which he navigated,
      discovering a new way to Maluco, which was in the year 1519,
      as I will relate further on in its place; with which he caused
      great difficulties to Portugal.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Correa again refers to the incident of Magellan remaining with the
    wreck, in his tome <span class="smcap">ii</span>, p. 625, where he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Fernan de Magalhāes, an honourable gentleman, who served in
      these parts in the time of the Viceroy Afonso <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>d’Alboquerque,
      of whom I made mention in the first book, with respect to two
      ships which were going to the kingdom, which were lost on the
      shoals of Padua, and their captains went back to Cochym in
      their boats, and this Fernan de Magalhāes remained in the ships
      with the men taking care of the ships until caravels came from
      Cochim in which much property, belonging to the king and to
      private individuals, was saved. This Fernan de Magalhāes, on
      going to the kingdom and bringing before the king his services,
      asked in satisfaction for them that he should have an increase
      in his palace stipend of a hundred reis a month, which the
      king refused him, because he did not find favour with him,
      or because it was so permitted to be. Fernan de Magalhāes,
      offended at this, because he much entreated the king to do it,
      and he would not, asked his leave to go and live with whoever
      would show him favour, where he might obtain more good fortune
      than with him. The king told him to do as he pleased; for which
      he wished to kiss his hand, which the king did not choose to
      give him.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Castanheda, in relating the wreck on the Padua banks, says (lib.
    <span class="smcap">iii</span>, cap. v):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“There were disputes as to who should go away with the captains
      from the grounded vessels, and Magellan said that it was clear
      that all could not go away, and that to avoid strife, which was
      commencing, let the gentlemen and chief men go away with the
      captains, and he would remain with the sailors and other common
      people, provided they would promise to return for him, or get
      the governor to send for him. This they swore to, and Fernan de
      Magalhāes stayed behind, the common people consented to remain,
      for otherwise there must have been strife. As Magalhāes was
      in the boat, when it was nearly ready to go away, a sailor,
      thinking that he repented himself of remaining, said to him:
      ‘Sir, did you not promise to remain with us?’ He replied: ‘Yes;
      and see, I am coming;’ and went to them and remained with them.
      In this he shewed great courage, and confidence in the men.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>Barros relates the incident of the two vessels wrecked on the banks of
    Padua, and says that Antonio Pacheco was sent with a caravel to their
    assistance; and that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“As much honour as Antonio Pacheco gained in the method with
      which he recovered these crews, with the differences which
      he had with them on account of some goods which the men took
      with them, so much honour also did Magellan gain by the good
      management of these men, which he shewed whilst waiting with
      them till they came to fetch them. And if he had had as much
      loyalty to his king and country, as he observed with a friend
      of his, on whose account he would not go away in company with
      Bastian de Sousa [the captain]; for they did not take away the
      other man, as he was not a man of much importance, perchance he
      would not have lost himself with a name of infamy, as will be
      seen further on.”—<cite>Decad.</cite> II, lib. <span class="smcap">iv</span>, chap. i.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thus Castanheda and Barros, who are both of them very hostile to
    Magellan, have preserved one of the finest traits of his life. Whether
    the motive of Magellan in remaining by the wreck was fidelity to the
    interests of his friend, or devotion to the common seamen, or the
    repugnance of an officer and a gentleman to abandon a ship which had
    not broken up, this trait is alone sufficient to show that he was
    incapable of disloyalty, or of being influenced by pique, as the
    Portuguese historians have represented.</p>

  <p>The next mention we find of Magellan is in the following document,
    preserved in the archives of Lisbon, which contains an account of a
    Council of War held by Albuquerque respecting his attack on Goa. This
    document confirms what Correa says of Albuquerque’s departure from
    Cochym for Goa.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span></p>

  <h3><i>Council held by Alfonso d’Albuquerque with the Captains with respect
    to going to Goa.</i></h3>

  <div class="center">Torre do Tombo. Corpo Chron. Part 2<i>a</i>, Maç 23, Doc. 190.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Thursday, which was the tenth day of the month of October,
      of five hundred and ten, the captain-major ordered all the
      captains of the king our sovereign to be summoned in Cochim,
      in order to hold a council with them, to which council there
      came those named below, and no others. This council was as to
      whether, whilst the ships of burden remained in Cochim taking
      in their cargo, it seemed good to them to carry all their crews
      with them to the action of Goa, or not.</p>

    <div class="center">•<span class="col3">•</span>
      <span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span></div>

    <p>Fernan de Magalhāes said that it seemed to him that the captain-major
      ought not to take the ships of burden to Goa, inasmuch as if they went
      thither they could not pass this year to Portugal, since we are at the
      twelfth of October; and that, making their shortest course without
      touching at Cananor, nor at any other port, it was not possible to lay
      the fleet before the port of Goa before the eighth of November,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> as
      the winds were now contrary for that place: and with respect to the
      crews, let his worship say whether it was well that they should go,
      that it seemed to him that he ought not to take them, since there did
      not remain time for them to lay out their money, nor to do anything of
      what was necessary for the voyage; and this said Fernan de Magalhāes.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>(N.B. Albuquerque said at the end of these opinions that he was
    determined to sail on the following day, the eleventh of October, with
    the captains who wished to accompany him. Therefore, <em>we are at the
    twelfth of October</em>, means that that day was close at hand, and not
    that the council was held on that day.)</p>

  <p>Gaspar Correa says, tome <span class="smcap">ii</span>, p. 138:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“When this was thus ended, the governor told all the captains
      that he was going immediately, and that he would sail from
      Cananor with all the ships and men that he could take, and go
      and take Goa, as he trusted in the Lord’s Passion that He would
      assist him; and he gave them notice that so he would act, and
      not occupy himself with anything else: and he gave them all
      this notice, because he trusted in the Lord, that he should
      be able to send news to the king in these ships, that he was
      taking his rest inside the city of Goa: and, as it was already
      October, whoever had the will to serve the king, and win such
      great honour, as it would be to find oneself in such a noble
      action, would still have time enough to witness the action and
      return to embark in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>his ship, carrying away so much honour
      from having been present in the action: and each one was to act
      according to his own will, for he would give an account of all
      to the king in his letters. But the captains, occupied with
      their profits of selling and taking in cargo, set little store
      by this, and the governor departed, saying that he was not
      going to take anyone away with him against his will.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Albuquerque then went to Cananor, which G. Correa says he again left
    on the 3rd October for Goa (tom. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, p. 140); <i>tres</i>
    is probably an error for <i>treze</i>, the 13th, which would be in
    accordance with the statement of the document that Albuquerque sailed
    from Cochim on the 11th of October. Gaspar Correa gives the following

  <p>The supposition may be hazarded that it was this opinion which Magellan
    gave at the Council of War in opposition to Alfonso d’Albuquerque,
    which set D. Manuel against him. Such opposition was enough to have
    made Albuquerque write unfavourably of Magellan to D. Manuel; and the
    ill-will of D. Manuel to Magellan, and his refusal to grant him a due
    recognition of his services is not otherwise sufficiently accounted
    for. On the other hand, Gaspar Correa, who was Albuquerque’s secretary
    at one time, does not indicate this; but Correa is the most friendly to
    Magellan of all the Portuguese historians, and does not appear, like
    the others, to have taxed Magellan with treason.</p>

  <p>After this, Magellan appears to have left India, and to have been
    stationed at Azamor in Morocco, where, in a skirmish with the Arabs,
    he was wounded in the leg by a javelin, which left him somewhat lame.
    After that, some disputes arose as to the distribution amongst the
    townsmen of some cattle that had been captured from the Arabs. When
    João Soarez, Captain of Azamor, left that place, and was succeeded by
    D. Pedro de Sousa, Magellan left Azamor without leave from D. Pedro de
    Sousa, and came to Portugal; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>his petition with regard to the increase
    of his palace stipend had already been sent to D. Manuel; but D. Pedro
    de Sousa having written to the king of Magellan having left Azamor
    without leave of absence, and of the complaints made about the cattle,
    the king refused to receive Magellan, and commanded him to return at
    once to Azamor, and there give himself up as he was accused. When he
    arrived there, as Barros says, either because he was free from blame,
    or, as was mostly asserted, because the frontier officers of Azamor,
    in order not to vex him, would not accuse him, he received a sentence
    of acquittal, and returned with it to Portugal; but the king always
    bore ill-will to him, and, Magellan’s requests not being granted, he
    set about that business of which he had written to his friend Francisco
    Serrano, who was in Maluco.</p>

  <p>After Magellan had disnaturalised himself, he took refuge in Spain,
    accompanied by the astrologer Ruy Faleiro, and having arrived at
    Seville on the 20th of October, 1517, he entered upon negotiations with
    the ministers of Charles V; and the King of Portugal did his utmost,
    through his agents, to thwart him; Osorio says that the king would
    have succeeded in dissuading Charles V from employing Magellan, had
    not the Spanish nobles persuaded him not to lose such an opportunity
    of increasing the Spanish empire. Charles V then ordered ships to be
    provided for Magellan, by which he might discover a new way to the east.</p>

  <p>Here follows an abstract of documents, copies of which are contained in
    the Torre do Tombo, relating to the appointment of Magellan, and the
    privileges and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>powers conferred upon him: these documents are dated
    in the spring of 1518, more than a year before Magellan sailed; and it
    appears that delay was caused partly through the procrastination of
    the Spanish authorities in Seville, who were charged with equipping
    the fleet, and partly by the intrigues of the agents of the King of
    Portugal. These intrigues appear to have been partially successful, and
    to have caused delay. A final order for the departure of Magellan was
    given in Barcelona, April 19th, 1519. The original of this document
    is preserved in the Lisbon archives, and it was probably carried out
    with the fleet, and fell into the possession of the Portuguese in the
    Moluccas after Magellan’s death; a translation of this order is given
    below, and the text is in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>After this document, translations are given of two letters (the text of
    which is given in the Appendix) from Alvaro da Costa, the Portuguese
    ambassador in Spain, and from Sebastian Alvarez, the Portuguese factor,
    about the efforts made by them to prevent Magellan’s expedition. M.
    Ferdinand Denis, in the <cite>Biographie Universelle</cite>, mentions that
    Alvaro da Costa is said to have pushed his zeal to the extremity of
    wishing to assassinate Magellan, and even his poor associate, Ruy
    Faleiro; this, with regard to the latter, seems hardly probable,
    judging from Costa’s own letter. Navarrete states that the Portuguese
    agents succeeding in exciting the mob of Seville against Magellan
    on the 22nd of October, 1518, under the empty pretext that he was
    substituting the arms of Portugal for those of Castile in his ships.

    <span class="smcap">iv</span>, cap. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 543, says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“D. Fernando de Vasconcellos, Bishop of Lamego, alone expressed
      the desire that the King of Portugal should either grant
      favours to him (Magellan) or else have him killed, because
      his intentions were most dangerous to the kingdom. The result
      of this (counsel) was that the kingdom received a great
      disappointment, and Magellan glorious and everlasting fame;
      since, whilst the world endures it will endure in the monument
      of his name, which has remained applied to all the South Sea
      and to his Straits.”</p>

    <p>Certificate given in Seville that the commendador Fernan de
      Magallanes, and the bachelor Ruy Faleiro, Portuguese, presented
      themselves at the Audiencia on the fourth of May, of 1518,
      before Dr. Sancho de Matienzo, the contador Juan Lopez de

      coloured wax at the back and other necessary signatures, and
      two royal orders (<i>cedulas</i>) of H.H. signed with his royal
      name, all written by the secretary Fernan de los Cobos, the
      tenour of all which, one after another, is as follows.</p>

    <p>The King:</p>

    <p>“Since you, Fernando de Magallanes, a knight, native of the
      Kingdom of Portugal, and the bachelor Ruy Faleiro, also a
      native of that kingdom, wish to render us a great service in
      the limits which belong to us in the ocean within the bounds
      of our demarcation, we order the following capitulation to be
      established with you for that purpose.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span>“Firstly: That you
      are to go with good luck to discover the part of the ocean
      within our limits and demarcation, and because it would not be
      in reason that, while you go to do the above mentioned, that
      other persons should cross you to do the same, and taking into
      consideration that you undertake the labour of this enterprise,
      it is my favour and will, and I promise that for the first ten
      following years we will not give leave to any person to go and
      discover by the same road and course by which you shall go;
      and if anyone desire to undertake it and should ask our leave
      for it, before giving it, we will let you know of it in order
      that if you should be ready to make it in that time in which
      they offer, you should do so, providing an equal sufficiency
      and equipment, and as many ships as the other persons who may
      wish to make the said discovery: but, be it understood that,
      if we please to send to discover, or to give leave for it to
      such other persons as we please by way of the south-west in
      the parts of the islands and mainland, and all other parts
      which are discovered towards the part where they are to seek
      the strait of those seas (para buscar el estrecho de aquellas
      mares),&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we may order it to be done, or give leave to other
      persons to do it, both of the mainland by the South Sea, which
      is discovered, or from the island of S. Miguel, if they wish
      to go and discover, they may do so. Also, if the governor
      and people who are now, by our orders, or may in future be
      in the said mainland, or other of our subjects may wish to
      discover in the South Sea, they may do so, notwithstanding the
      above, or any section or clause of this capitulation. Also,
      you may discover in any of those parts what has not yet been
      discovered, so that you do not discover nor do anything in the
      demarcation and limits of the most serene King of Portugal,
      my very dear and well-beloved uncle and brother, nor to his
      prejudice, but only within the limits of our demarcation.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span></p>

    <p>In consideration of their good-will and services, the next
      paragraph grants the right to levy upon any isles or countries
      settled by them after the expenses have been paid, a twentieth
      part, with the title of our Adelantados and Governors of the
      said countries and isles, “you, and your sons and rightful
      heirs for ever, so that they remain for us and the kings that
      may come after us, and your sons and heirs being natives of our
      realms and married in them; and of this we will send you your
      formal letter of privileges.”</p>

    <p>The next paragraph grants the right to invest in goods each
      year the value of a thousand ducats, cost price, to sell in the
      islands and countries, and bring back the returns, paying only
      a twentieth in duty to the king without other payment. This
      only after the return from the voyage, not during it.</p>

    <p>Also to grant them greater favour, if more than six islands
      should be discovered; after six have been set apart for the
      king, they might mark out two from which they might take the
      fifteenth part of all the net profits and duties of the king
      after the expenses had been deducted.</p>

    <p>Also of all the net profit that there may be for the king on
      the return of the fleet, after this first voyage, deducting its
      expense, they may take a fifth part.</p>

    <p>“In order that you may better carry this out, I will order the
      equipment of five ships, two of one hundred and thirty tons
      each, and two others of ninety, and another of sixty tons,
      provided with men, victuals, and artillery; that is to say,
      that the said ships shall be supplied for two years, and there
      shall go in them two hundred and thirty-four persons for their
      management: amongst masters, mariners, ship-boys, and all
      other people that are of necessity, according to the memorial,
      and this we will order to be carried out by our officers in
      Seville.”</p>

    <p>Also if either of them died, this agreement was to be kept
      with, and by the other, as it would have been kept with both if
      they were alive.</p>

    <p>The next paragraph says that a factor, a treasurer, an
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>accountant, and clerks of the said ships, shall keep the
      accounts of all the expenses of the fleet.</p>

    <p>“All which I promise and plight my faith and royal word that
      I will order it to be observed to you, in all and for all,
      according as is contained above, and upon it I have ordered
      this present to be given, signed with my name. Dated in
      Valladolid, the twenty-second day of March, of five hundred and
      eighteen years.”</p>

  <p>Another copy of the same document has the heading:—</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>Another letter, also dated Valladolid, March 22nd, 1518, and signed
    by the king, and the secretary Francisco de los Cobos, and signed at
    the back by Joanes Beijamanse, Fonseca Archiepiscopus, Episcopus,
    registered, Johan de Samana, Guillermo Chancellor, confers upon
    Magellan the power of deciding and executing short and summary justice
    by sea or land in case of suits or disputes arising in the fleet.</p>

  <p>Another royal letter of the same date as the above <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>orders the officers
    of the India House to provide Magellan with five ships, crews,
    provisions, etc., according to the memorial which is signed by our
    chancellor of Bargonha and by the Archbishop of Rosano and Bishop of
    Burgos; and bids them use all dispatch.</p>

  <p>Another royal letter, dated Aranda, 17th of April, 1518, to Magellan
    and Ruy Faleiro, says that if, after they shall have sailed, either
    or both of them should die, and that they should have given to the
    people in the fleet instructions and orders which should be necessary
    for the discovery; and if they, profiting by them, should discover the
    isles and parts which they were going to discover, then their heirs and
    successors should enjoy the favours and privileges contained in the
    said capitulations.</p>

  <p>The document then states that Magellan and Ruy Faleiro having presented
    the capitulations and letters and royal orders of his highness to the
    said judges, they summoned and required them to fulfil them according
    to their contents, and they requested this in the presence of the
    witnesses, Francisco de Santa Cruz, alguazil Lorenzo Pinelo, and
    Francisco de Collantes, porter of the Audiencia of the said House.
    Then the judges took the letters in their hands, and kissed them, and
    put them on their heads, as the orders of their king, and natural
    sovereign, whom may God suffer to live and reign many years; and they
    would answer more at length in complying with the orders. Witnesses the
    above-named.</p>

  <p>After that, on Monday, at the Audiencia de la Nona, on the thirty-first
    day of May of 1518, the said judges, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>Dr. Sancho de Matienzo and the
    contador Juan Lopez de Ricalde, appeared before me, the said Juan
    Gutierrez Calderon, the above-mentioned clerk and notary, and presented
    an answer signed with their names to the presentation made by the
    Portuguese captains of the royal orders and letters. And this reply is
    as follows.</p>

  <p>The said judges state, in reply, that the king’s letters order them
    to provide five ships, and men and provisions as may be necessary, in
    conformity with a memorial which the captains bring, signed by the
    great Chancellor of Burgundy and by the very Reverend Archbishop of
    Rosano and Bishop of Burgos, which said memorial up to this time has
    not been shown to us, and without it we cannot undertake anything; so
    let his Highness send us orders according to that the said despatch
    signed, as has been said, by the chancellor and bishop; and we are
    ready to fulfil the orders which his Highness sends, having at the time
    moneys of his Highness in our power. This they said, and gave as their
    answers, and signed it with their names, Doctor Matienzo, Juan Lopez de
    Ricalde.</p>

  <p>Magellan and Ruy Faleiro asked from Juan Gutierres Calderon, Clerk and
    Notary Public, a certificate and legalised copy of what had passed for
    the conservation of their rights, which he accordingly gave him, dated
    on the said day and month (31st May) of 1518.</p>

  <p>The letter, the text of which is given in the Appendix No.
    <span class="smcap">iii</span>, the original of which appears to have fallen into the
    hands of the Portuguese at the Moluccas, is as follows:</p>

    Magalhaes.</i></h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Sire,</p>

    <p>With respect to the business of Fernam de Magalhaes, I have
      done and laboured very much, as God knows, as I have written
      to you at length; and now, Xebres being ill, I have spoken
      on this matter very firmly to the king, laying before him
      all the objections that there were in it, and besides other
      matters, setting forth how ill-seeming and unusual a matter
      it was for a king to receive the vassals of another king his
      friend, against his will; which was a thing which was not usual
      amongst knights, and was held to be a great fault, and a very
      ill-looking thing: also that I had just before offered to him
      in Valladolid the services of your royal self, and kingdom and
      lordships, while he was already receiving these men against
      your pleasure; and I begged him to look well that this was not
      a time for causing discontent to your Highness, especially in
      a matter of such little importance to him, and of such little
      certainty, and that he had many vassals and men for making
      discoveries when the time came, without making use of those
      who came away from your Highness discontented, and that your
      Highness could not fail to suspect that these men would labour
      more to do you a dis-service than for anything else; and that
      his Highness had now so much to do with discovering his own
      kingdoms and lordships, and settling them, that such novelties
      ought hardly to come into his recollection, from which scandals
      might follow, and other things which might well be dispensed
      with. I also laid before him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>how ill this appeared in the year
      and period of the marriage, and increase of family duty and
      affection, and that it seemed to me that your Highness would
      feel deeply the knowledge that these men asked his leave to
      return, and that he did not give it; which would be two evils,
      the receiving them against your will, and the retaining them
      against their own wills: and I begged him on account of what
      was fitting for his service, and for that of your Highness that
      of two things he should do one, either give them leave to go,
      or lay aside this business for this year, by which much would
      not be lost, and such means might be taken that he might be
      served without your Highness receiving displeasure from the
      manner in which this should be done.</p>

    <p>He, Sire, remained so surprised at what I said to him, that I
      was amazed; and he replied to me with the best words in the
      world, and that on no account did he desire that anything
      should be done, by which your Highness should be displeased,
      and many other good words; and he told me to speak to the
      Cardinal, and to relate everything to him. I, Sire, had already
      talked it all well over with the Cardinal, who is the best
      thing here, and this business does not seem good to him, and
      he promised me to labour as much as he could to avoid speaking
      to the king; and for this purpose they summoned the Bishop of
      Burgos, who is the person who upholds this business, and so two
      of the Council again made the king believe that in this he was
      not in fault towards your Highness, because he was not sending
      to make discoveries except within his limit, and very far off
      from the affairs of your Highness; and that your Highness ought
      not to take it ill that he made use of two of your vassals,
      men of little substance, while your Highness was making use of
      the services of many natives of Castile; and they alleged many
      other arguments: lastly, the Cardinal told me that the Bishop
      and those men used so much urgency in this, that at present the
      king could not take any other determination.</p>

    <p>As long as Xebres was well I continued to set this business
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span>before him, as I have said, and much more. He puts the blame
      upon these Castilians who lead the king into this matter,
      and withal that, he will speak to the king. Some days past I
      entreated him much about this business, and he never took a
      determination, and I think that he will do likewise now. It
      appears to me, Sire, that your Highness might get back Fernam
      de Magalhāes, which would be a great buffet to these people. I
      do not reckon the bachelor [Ruy Faleiro] for much, for he is
      almost out of his mind. I took steps with Dom Jorge&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with
      respect to the going there of his alcaide, and he says that
      he will go at any rate; so, Sire, as this is in this manner,
      for all that, I will never desist from striving in this to the
      extent of my power.
    </p>

    <p>Let not your Highness consider that I said much to the king in
      what I did say to him, because, besides what I said being all
      true, these people, as I say, do not feel anything, neither has
      the king liberty up to this time to do anything of himself,
      and on this account what he does (<em>his affairs</em>) need to
      be felt less. The Lord increase the life and State of your
      Highness for His holy service. From Saragoça, Tuesday at night,
      the twenty-eighth of September [1518].&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <h3><i>Letter from Sebastian Alvarez, Factor of Dom Manuel, to the King,
    dated Seville, July 18, 1519.</i></h3>

  <div class="center">(Torre do Tombo. Corp. Chronol., Part I. Maço 13, Doc. 20.)</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Sire,</p>

    <p>On the 15th of this July I received through Chavascas, the
      equerry, two letters from your Highness, one of the 18th and
      the other of the 29th of last month, which I understood, and
      without recapitulating the second one, I answer your Highness.</p>

    <p>There have now arrived together in this city, Christopher de
      Haro and Juan de Cartagena, the chief factor of the fleet and
      captain of a ship, and the treasurer and clerk of this fleet;
      and in the regulations which they bring there are clauses
      contrary to the instructions of Fernan de Magalhāes; these
      having been seen by the accountant and factors of the House of
      Trade, they seek how they can embroil the affairs of Magellan,
      and they were at once of the opinion of those who have recently
      arrived.</p>

    <p>Together, they sent to summon Fernan de Magalhāes, and
      requested to know from him the order of this fleet, and the
      cause why there was no captain going in the fourth ship, but
      only Carvalho, who was a pilot and not a captain. He replied,
      that he wished to take the ship thus for it to carry the
      lantern, and for him to pass over to it from time to time.</p>

    <p>And they said to him that he carried many Portuguese, and that
      it was not well that he should take so many. He answered, that
      he would do what he chose in the fleet without giving them
      any account, and that they could not do it without rendering
      account to him. There passed between them so many and such
      evil words, that the factors ordered pay to be issued to the
      seamen and men-at-arms, but not to any of the Portuguese whom
      Magellan and Ruy Faleiro have got to take with them, and at the
      same time a courier was sent to the Court of Castile.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>As I
      saw the matter was begun and the season convenient for saying
      that which your Highness bade me say, I went to the lodgings
      of Magellan, where I found him arranging baskets and boxes
      with victuals of conserves and other things. I pressed him,
      feigning, that as I found him thus occupied, it seemed to me
      that the undertaking of his evil design was settled, and that,
      as this would be the last conversation I should have with him,
      I wished to recall to his memory how many times, as a good
      Portuguese and his friend, I had spoken to him, and opposed the
      great error which he was committing.</p>

    <p>After begging his pardon, if he should receive from me any
      offence in the conversation, I called to his recollection how
      often I had spoken to him, and how well he had always answered
      me, and that, according to his replies, I had always hoped
      that at the end he would not go to the so great dis-service
      of your Highness; and that what I always told him was that
      he should see that this road had as many dangers as Saint
      Catharine’s wheel, and that he ought to leave it and take
      the straight road,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and return to his native country and
      the favour of your Highness, where he would always receive
      benefits. In this conversation I introduced all the dangers
      which appeared to me, and the faults which he was committing.
      He said to me, that now he could do nothing else, for his
      honour’s sake, except follow his path. I said to him, that to
      acquire honour unduly, and when acquired by such infamy, was
      neither wisdom nor honour, but rather deprivation of wisdom and
      honour, for he might be certain that the chief Castilians of
      this city, when speaking of him, held him to be a vile man, of
      low blood, since to the dis-service of his true king and lord
      he accepted such an enterprise; and so much the more since it
      was prepared, concerted, and requested by him, that he might
      be sure that he was held to be a traitor in going against the
      State of your Highness. Here he answered me that he saw the
      fault he was committing, but that he hoped to observe <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>the
      service of your Highness, and to do you great service by his
      going. I told him that whoever should praise such a speech, did
      not understand the matter, because, supposing that he did not
      touch any of the conquest of your Highness, how was he going
      to discover what he talked of; moreover, it was to the great
      detriment of the revenues of your Highness, and this would be
      sustained by the whole realm and by all sorts of persons: and
      that thought of his had been a more virtuous one which he had
      when he said to me that, if your Highness ordered him to return
      to Portugal, he would do so without any other assurance of
      favours, and that should your Highness not confer them, there
      was always Serradossa and seven ells of serge, and some beads
      of acorns.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It seemed to me then that his heart was true as
      to what befitted his honour and conscience; that which was said
      was so much that it is not possible to write it.</p>

    <p>Here, Sire, he began to give a sign, telling me to tell him
      more, that this did not come from myself, and that if your
      Highness had bidden me say it, that I should tell him, and the
      favour which you would confer upon him. I told him that I was
      not of so much tonnage as that your Highness should put me
      into such a business; but I said it to him as I had done on
      many other occasions. Here he wished to do me honour, saying
      that if what I had begun with him, went forward, without other
      persons intervening, that your Highness would be served; but
      that Nuño Ribeiro had told him one thing, and that it was of no
      importance; and Joam Mendez, another, and that these did not
      agree; and he told me the favour which they promised on behalf
      of your Highness. Here he made a great lamentation, and said
      that he felt it all, but that he did not know of anything by
      means of which he could reasonably leave a king who had shown
      him so much favour. I told him that to do that which he ought
      and not to lose his honour, and the favour which your Highness
      would confer upon him, would be more certain and accompanied
      by truer honour: and that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>he should weigh his coming from
      Portugal, which had been for a hundred reals, more or less, of
      allowances,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which your Highness had not granted him, so
      as not to break your ordinance, and that two regulations had
      arrived contrary to his, and that which he had contracted with
      the King Don Carlos, and he would see whether that neglect
      weighed more, for him to go and do what he ought to do, or come
      here for that which he had come for.</p>

    <p>He wondered much at my knowing so much, and here he told me
      the truth, and that the courier had left: all which I knew.
      And he told me that certainly there would be no reason for his
      throwing over the undertaking, unless they deprived him of
      anything which had been assigned him by the contract. But first
      he had to see what your Highness would do. I said to him, what
      more did he want to see than the instructions, and Ruy Faleiro,
      who said openly that he was not going to follow his lantern,
      and that he would navigate to the south, or would not go in the
      fleet? also, that he thought he was going as captain-major,
      whilst I knew that others were sent in opposition, whom he
      would not know of except at a time when he could not remedy
      his honour; and that he should not pay attention to the honey,
      which the Bishop of Burgos put to his lips, and that now
      was the fit time for him to see whether he would do it, and
      that he should give me a letter for your Highness, and that
      I from affection for him would go to your Highness to act on
      his behalf, because I had no message&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> from your Highness
      to occupy myself with the like, but that I only spoke what I
      thought as at other times I had done. He said to me that he
      would not say anything to me until he saw the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>message which
      the courier brought: and with this we concluded. I will watch
      the service of your Highness to the full extent of my power.</p>

    <p>At this juncture, it seems to me well that your Highness should
      know that it is certain that the navigation which these men
      hope to perform is known to the King Don Carlos, and Fernan
      Magellan has told me as much, and there might be some one to
      undertake the enterprise who would do more harm. I spoke to
      Ruy Faleiro on two occasions. He never answered me anything
      else than, how could he do anything against the king his lord,
      who did him such favour. To all that I said to him, he did
      not reply anything else. It seems to me that he is like a man
      deranged in his senses, and that this familiar of his has
      deprived him of whatever knowledge there was in him. It seems
      to me that, if Fernan Magellan were removed, that Ruy Faleiro
      would follow whatever Magellan did.</p>

    <p>The ships of Magellan’s fleet, Sire, are five; that is to say,
      one of a hundred and ten tons, two of eighty tons each, and the
      other two of sixty tons each, a little more or less. They are
      very old and patched up; for I saw them when they were beached
      for repairs. It is eleven months since they were repaired, and
      they are now afloat, and they are caulking them in the water. I
      went on board of them a few times, and I assure your Highness
      that I should be ill inclined to sail in them to the Canaries,
      because their knees are of touchwood.</p>

    <p>The artillery which they all carry are eighty guns, of a very
      small size; only in the largest ship, in which Magellan is
      going, there are four very good iron cannon. All the crews whom
      they take in all the five vessels are two hundred and thirty
      men. The greater number have already received their pay; only
      the Portuguese, who will not accept a thousand reis, and who
      are waiting for the courier to arrive, because Magellan told
      them that he would get their pay increased, and they carry
      provisions for two years.</p>

    <p>The captain of the first ship is Fernan Magellan, and of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span>the
      second, Ruy Faleiro; of the third, Juan de Cartagena, who
      is the chief factor of the fleet; of the fourth, Quesada, a
      dependant of the Archbishop of Seville; the fifth goes without
      any known captain, —— Carvalho, a Portuguese, goes in her as
      pilot. Here it is said that, as soon as they are out of the
      mouth of the river, he will put into her, as captain, Alvaro da
      Mesquita of Estremoz, who is here.</p>

    <p>The Portuguese who have come here to sail are,</p>

    <ul class="mt0 mb0">
      <li class="isub1">—— Carvalho, pilot.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Estevan Gomez, pilot.</li>

      <li class="isub1">—— Serrāo, pilot.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Vasco Galego, pilot; he has been living here for some time.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Alvaro de Mesquita of Estremoz.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Martin da Mesquita of Estremoz.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Francisco d’Afonseca, son of the Corregidor of Rosmaninhal.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Christopher Ferreira, son of the Corregidor of Castelejo.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Martin Gil, son of the Judge for the Orphans of Lisbon.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Pero d’Abreu, a dependent of the Bishop of Zafy.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Duarte Barbosa, nephew of Diogo Barbosa, a dependent of the
        Bishop of Siguenza.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Antonio Fernandez, who lived in the Moorish quarter of
        Lisbon.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Luis Affonso of Beja, who was a dependent of the Lady
        Infanta, whom may God have in His keeping.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Juan da Silva, son of Nuno da Silva, of the island of
        Madeira. This man has always told me that he would not go
        unless, if your Highness held it to be for your service,
        and he behaves as a concealed friend.</li>

      <li class="isub1">Faleiro has got here his father and mother, and brothers,
        one of whom he takes with him.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other small people of the servants of these also say that they
      are going, of which I will make a report to your Highness, if
      you command it, when they go.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span>The fifth part of this armament
      is from Cristoval de Haro, who has spent on it four thousand
      ducats. They say here that your Highness had ordered to take
      from him there [in Portugal] twenty thousand cruzados of
      property. He gives here information about the fleets of your
      Highness, both of what is done, and of what is to be done. I
      learned that by a servant of his whom he has got there; by
      obtaining from him the letters, your Highness might be able to
      know by what means he learns these secrets.</p>

    <p>The goods which they take are copper, quicksilver, common
      cloths of colours, common coloured silks, and jackets made of
      these silks.</p>

    <p>It is assured that this fleet will start down the river at the
      end of this July; but it does not seem so to me, nor before
      the middle of August, even though the courier should come more
      quickly.</p>

    <p>The course which it is said they are to take is straight to
      Cape Frio, Brasil remaining on their right hand, until they
      reach the line of the demarcation; from thence they are to
      navigate to the west and west-north-west, straight to Maluco,
      which land of Maluco I have seen laid down on the sphere
      and map, which the son of Reynell made here, which was not
      completed when his father came here for him; and his father
      finished it all, and placed these lands of Maluco; and after
      this pattern all the maps are made, which Diogo Ribeiro makes,
      and he makes the compasses, quadrants, and globes, but he does
      not go in the fleet, nor does he wish to do more than gain his
      living by his skill.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

    <p>From this Cape Frio, until the islands of Maluco throughout
      this navigation, there are no lands laid down in the maps which
      they carry with them. Please God the Almighty that they may
      make such a voyage as did the Cortereals,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">xlv</span>and that your
      Highness may be at rest, and for ever be envied, as you are, by
      all princes.</p>

    <p>Sire, another fleet is being prepared of three small rotten
      ships, in which Andres Niño goes as captain; he takes out,
      inside these old ships, two other small vessels built in
      pieces; he goes to the mainland which Pedre Ayres discovered,
      to the port of Larym, and from thence he is to go by land
      twenty leagues to the South Sea, whither he is to carry by land
      the newly-built ships, with the rigging of the old ones, and to
      fit them out on that South Sea, and with these vessels he is to
      discover for a thousand leagues, and not more, towards the west
      of the coasts of the land which is named Gataio; and in these
      Gil Gonzalez, the accountant of the Island of Hispaniola, is
      to go as captain-major, and they are going for two years. When
      these fleets have sailed, another of four ships will then be
      made to go, as it is said, on the track of Magellan; but, as
      this is not yet put into gear for performance, nothing certain
      is known: and this is arranged by Christoval do Haro. Whatever
      more may occur, I will make known to your Highness.</p>

    <p>As to the news of the fleet which the King Don Carlos orders
      to be built to defend himself from, or to attack France, or to
      go to the Empire, as it is said, I excuse myself from writing
      of it to your Highness, since your Highness will obtain them
      with more certainty from Nuno Ribeiro, who is in Cartagena. But
      there is certain news in this city by letters, that the King of
      France announces that the King Don Carlos is not going to be
      emperor, and that he will be it. The Pope assists the King of
      France in an honest way. He grants to him four cardinal’s hats
      for him to give to whomsoever he pleases. It is said that the
      King of France keeps them to give to those whom the electors of
      the empire might wish. There it is assured that either the King
      of France will be emperor or else the person he may choose. I
      will take especial care to inform your Highness of what more
      happens with these fleets, although I had become cool in this
      matter, because it seemed to me that your Highness wished to
      learn it from some one else; for I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</span>saw here Nuno Ribeiro and
      other persons who spoke to me in a dissembling manner, and
      seeking to learn about me. I kiss the hands of your Highness.
      From Seville, the 18th of July, of 1519.</p>

  <p>The long interval which elapsed before the example set by Magellan was
    followed by Drake and Van Noort (for the expedition of the Comendador
    Loaysa in 1527, and two others having failed, this voyage was not again
    attempted in those times by the Spaniards) is a proof that greater
    hardihood was displayed in Magellan’s voyage than in those of Columbus
    and Gama; and the fortitude and constancy of Magellan appear strongly
    from the foregoing despatches, since in addition to the physical
    difficulties of his enterprise, he had to struggle against intrigues,
    jealousy, and the alternate upbraiding and cajolery of the King of
    Portugal’s agents. The despatch of Sebastian Alvarez to Dom Manuel,
    though biassed as it naturally is, shows that whatever he and the
    Portuguese of that day thought of Magellan’s design, he himself did not
    consider that he was doing anything injurious to his king or country,
    and Camoens, though he repeats the hackneyed accusation of disloyalty
    against Magellan, yet boasts of his achievements as a lasting honour to
    Portugal, in the following lines:</p>

  <p>The poet of the Lusiad, who had said that the Muses sang of Gama
    unwillingly, here concludes his praises of Magellan with a promise to
    the Portuguese of ever renewed praise—a promise which will be fulfilled
    by posterity whenever the character and enterprise of Magellan are
    compared with those of his contemporaries; for whilst the cruelty and
    violence of Gama, and the difficulty his companions had in restraining
    him, were very serious defects in his character, Magellan gave <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</span>many
    noble examples of the opposite virtues and of other qualities of a
    very high order. His conduct on the occasion of the shipwreck near the
    Maldive Islands has been already described; the clemency with which
    he tempered justice when he put down the mutiny in Port St. Julian—a
    mutiny which Sebastian Alvarez, the King of Portugal’s agent, would
    appear to have been privy to, if indeed he did not prepare it, shows
    great self-restraint, and the whole of his conduct in the islands of
    Sebu and Matan, where he fell, defending the retreat of his companions,
    is more like that of the knights errant of an earlier date, than that
    of his contemporaries. Pigafetta, who was with him at his death, was
    deeply affected by it, and recounts his many virtues and qualities in
    an appeal to the Grand Master of Rhodes not to allow Magellan’s memory
    to be lost.</p>

  <p>Most of the captains of ships at this time, and long afterwards,
    were soldiers put into naval commands; but Magellan, besides being
    a military officer, was also an experienced and learned navigator,
    and Pigafetta’s Treatise of Navigation may be taken as the result of
    Magellan’s instruction in that art.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">xlix</span>
    voyage of Columbus, which employed only thirty-three days out and
    twenty-eight homeward-bound, cannot be compared with that of Magellan,
    and if Columbus was as good a seaman and navigator as Magellan, yet a
    certain superiority must be allowed to the latter on account of his
    numerous military exploits in India and Africa.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to ascertain who was Juan Serrano, who remained in
    the hands of the Sebu islanders after the massacre of Duarte Barbosa
    and his companions, and in Navarrete he is sometimes spoken of as an
    inhabitant of Seville and sometimes as a Portuguese. Pigafetta speaks
    of him as a Spaniard, but the despatch of Sebastian Alvarez leaves
    no doubt as to his being Portuguese, which otherwise might have been
    inferred from his being a <i>compadre</i> of Joan Carvalho. It is
    probable that he was a relation of Francisco Serrano, the friend and
    correspondent of Magellan, who died in Ternate about eight months
    before the arrival at Tidore of Magellan’s ships: it is also probable
    that he was the same Juan Serrano whose voyage with Francisco Serrano
    in 1512 from Malacca to the Java Seas is related in the book of Duarte
    Barbosa on the coasts of East Africa and Malabar (Hakluyt Society).</p>

  <p>Sebastian de Elcano, a native of Guetaria in Biscay, had the good
    fortune to be in command of the <cite>Victoria</cite> on her return to
    Seville, and though his name is not mentioned during the voyage in any
    of the narratives, he reaped the principal rewards of the expedition,
    and on his arrival at Court, received from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">l</span>Charles V a pension of
    five hundred gold crowns, and was authorised to take for arms a globe,
    with the motto “Primus me circumdedisti”. Amongst other sonnets to his
    memory, are the following:</p>

  <p>This volume contains six contemporary accounts of Magellan’s voyage for
    the circumnavigation of the globe: one was written by a Genoese pilot
    of the fleet; the second by a Portuguese companion of Duarte Barbosa,
    which has been preserved by Ramusio; the third by Antonio Pigafetta
    of Vicenza; and the fourth is a letter of Maximilian Transylvanus, a
    Secretary of the Emperor Charles V; the fifth a log book of a pilot
    named Francisco Albo or Alvaro; the sixth is taken from Gaspar Correa’s
    <cite>Lendas da India</cite>.</p>

  <p>Of Pigafetta’s account, four manuscripts are known, three of them are
    in French, and one in Italian. Two of the French manuscripts are in
    the Bibliothèque Impériale of Paris; one of these, numbered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">li</span>5,650,
    is on paper; the other, numbered 68, of the Lavallière collection,
    is on vellum, and is richly illuminated; it does not contain the
    Brazilian and Patagonian vocabularies given in No. 5,650, and some
    rather indecent details are omitted or softened down, which leads to
    the conclusion that this copy was the one presented by Pigafetta to
    the Regent, Louise of Savoy. The third French manuscript, and the most
    complete, was in the possession of M. Beaupré of Nancy till 1855, it
    then passed into the Solar collection, and in 1861 was sold for 1,650
    francs to a London book-seller, and, later, was bought by Sir Thomas
    Phillipps at Libri’s sale.</p>

  <p>M. Rd. Thomassy published a memoir in the <cite>Bulletin de la Société
    de Géographie</cite> of Paris, September 1843, in which he examines the
    question whether Pigafetta composed his account of his voyage in
    French. He has come to a conclusion (which M. Ferdinand Denis has also
    adopted) in favour of the French manuscript having been originally
    composed by Pigafetta, and not translated from the Italian, on the
    grounds of its being addressed to the grand master of Rhodes, Villiers
    de l’Ile-Adam, who was himself a Frenchman, and that Pigafetta had
    recently been made a Knight of Rhodes; and that Pigafetta used the
    French language for the device which he set up over his paternal house
    in the street of la Luna in Vicenza, “Il n’y a pas de roses sans
    épines”; that other Italians of the time had written in French; that
    the Italian MS. of the Ambrosian Library of Milan, published in 1800 by
    Amoretti, is in bad Italian, mixed with Venetian and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">lii</span>Spanish, so that
    M. Amoretti saw in it rather a copy than the original of the relation
    presented to the Pope or to the Grand Master; these defects M. Amoretti
    removed by translating them into good Italian: also that the French
    edition of Fabre, though stated to be a translation from the Italian,
    was used in 1536 to publish an Italian edition; whereas if an Italian
    edition had existed before, that of Fabre would not have been required.
    Fabre’s edition, moreover, is very imperfect; and he puts what
    Pigafetta says in the third person. M. Thomassy concludes, therefore,
    that the version of Fabre was made from some Italian <i>resumé</i>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the motives urged by M. Thomassy for believing that
    Pigafetta himself composed the French manuscripts, there is evidence of
    it in the phraseology of the MSS.; had these been translations from the
    Italian, every word would have been translated into French, whereas,
    instead of that, we find a great many Italian words used, especially
    in the vocabularies, also some Italian idioms. It was natural that
    Pigafetta, if he had not the French word at command, should write down
    an Italian one, such as “calcagno” for “talon”.</p>

  <p>For the same reason, I should be inclined to believe that the Ambrosian
    MS., with its mixture of Spanish words, was composed by Pigafetta
    himself, in whom such a mixture of words would be more natural after so
    long a voyage in a Spanish ship, than in an Italian scribe.</p>

  <p>That Pigafetta did compose a work in Italian appears <span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">liii</span>from a document
    in the archives of Venice, containing a petition of Pigafetta to the
    Doge and Council of Venice, dated August 5th, 1524, applying for leave
    to print his account of his circumnavigation of the globe, and to have
    a privilege for twenty years. This is followed by a statement that the
    prayer of the petition was granted by the Doge and 152 of the Council,
    six members of which voted against Pigafetta. The text of this document
    is given in the Appendix; it was communicated to me by the Geographical
    Society of Paris, which has published a translation of it in its
    bulletin of February 1869.</p>

  <p>Until M. Amoretti published his edition of Pigafetta from the Ambrosian
    MS. in 1800, there never was a complete or an original Italian edition
    of Pigafetta; for the quarto edition of 1536 (Grenville, 6,977),
    without name of author or printer, is, as is mentioned in the address
    to the reader, a translation from the edition of Jacques Fabre. This
    edition of 1536 had a privilege for fourteen years; it must be by
    Ramusio, for the address to the reader is almost the same as his more
    abridged “discourse” in his collection of travels of Venice, 1550, and
    Venice, 1613, folio, 346 v. In Ramusio’s collection, and in the edition
    of 1536, Pigafetta’s voyage is preceded by the letter of Maximilian
    Transylvanus, Secretary of the Emperor Charles V, to the Cardinal of
    Salzburg. This letter of Maximilian’s is not quite the same in the two
    books in the division of the paragraphs; in Pigafetta’s voyage there is
    greater similarity, and the paragraphs are numbered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">liv</span>identically in the
    edition of 1536 and in Fabre’s French edition. Ramusio says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Magellan’s voyage was written, with details, by Don Pietro
      Martire, of the Council of the Indies of the Emperor, and
      that he had examined all those who had survived the voyage,
      and returned to Seville in the year 1522; but, having sent it
      to be printed at Rome, in the miserable sack of that town it
      was lost, and it is not yet known where it is. One who saw
      it and read it gives testimony of it, and amongst the other
      things worthy of recollection which the above-named Don Pietro
      noted in this voyage, was that the Spaniards having navigated
      about three years and a month, and the greater part of them
      (as is the custom of those who navigate on the ocean) having
      noted down each day of each month, when they rejoined Spain
      they found they had lost one day; that is, when they reached
      the port of Seville, which was on the 7th of September, by
      the account which they had kept it was the 6th. Don Pietro
      having related this particularity to an excellent and rare
      man, Sig. Gasparo Contarino,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a Venetian senator, who was
      then in Spain as ambassador to his Majesty from his Republic,
      and having asked him how it could be, he, as a very great
      philosopher, shewed him that it could not be otherwise, as they
      had navigated three years, always accompanying the sun, which
      was going westwards; and he said that the ancients had observed
      that those who navigated to the west greatly lengthened their day.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This book of Don Pietro’s having been lost, says Ramusio, he thought
    of translating the Latin letter of Maximilian, and of adding to it the
    summary of a book which was written by the valiant knight of Rhodes,
    Messer Antonio Pigafetta, a Vicentine; and this said book was abridged
    and translated into French by a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">lv</span>very learned philosopher, named Messer
    Jacopo Fabri, of Paris, at the instance of the most serene mother of
    the most Christian King Francis, Madame Louisa the Regent, to whom the
    aforesaid knight had made a present of one [of his books].</p>

  <p>This French epitome by Fabre is a small octavo of seventy-six leaves,
    in Gothic type (Grenville, 7,065); it is without date; the title is as
    follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Le Voyage et Navigation, faict par les Espaignolz es Isles
      de Mollucques, des isles quilz out trouue audict voyage, des
      Roys dicelles, de leur gouuernment &amp; maniere de viure, auec
      plusieurs aultres choses.”</p>

    <p>“Cum Priuilegio, ¶ on les vend a Paris en la maison de Simon de
      Colines, libraire iure de luniuersite de Paris, demeurāt en la
      rue sainct Jehan de Beauluais, a lenseigne du Soleil Dor.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">Simon de Colines, the printer, issued his last work in 1546, and his
    heirs are mentioned on a work of 1550.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>In 1801, a French translation of Amoretti’s edition of Pigafetta was
    published by H. J. Jansen, who added a translation from the German of
    M. de Murr’s Notice on the Chevalier M. Behaim. In this translation,
    some liberties have been taken with the text; and it is to be regretted
    that this translation was published instead of the French text
    contained in the two MSS. of the Bibliothèque Impériale; these, even
    were they not Pigafetta’s own composition, possess a philological
    interest of their own.</p>

  <p>An English translation of Pigafetta by Richard <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvi">lvi</span>Wren, London, 1625, is
    mentioned in <cite>l’Art de Vérifier les Dates, depuis 1770</cite>, folio,
    vol. iii, p. 333. There is no copy of this in the British Museum
    Library.</p>

  <p>The other contemporaneous account of Magellan’s voyage, a translation
    of which precedes that of Pigafetta’s account, is by a Genoese pilot.
    This pilot probably was named Mestre Bautista, since Barros mentions
    him as a Genoese who, on the death of the pilot Joan Carvalho, was
    charged with piloting the <cite>Trinidad</cite>, which got as far as Ternate.
    Correa (tom. ii, p. 632) also mentions that Mestre Joan Bautista was
    made captain instead of Carvalho, after he had allowed the son of the
    King of Luzon to escape at Borneo. Of this account, three manuscripts
    exist; all three are in Portuguese. From two of these MSS. a printed
    edition was published in the <cite>Noticias Ultramarinas</cite>, No.
    <span class="smcap">ii</span>, by the Academy of History of Lisbon. The text which served
    for this publication was a MS. which belonged to the library of the
    monks of S. Bento da Saude; and it has been supplemented and annotated
    from another manuscript, which is in the Bibliothèque Impériale at
    Paris, numbered 7158⁄33, a copy of which was made by Dr. Antonio Nunes
    de Carvalho in 1831. A third manuscript of this pilot’s narrative
    exists in the library of the Academy of History of Madrid, No. 30, Est.
    11a, grada 2a.</p>

  <p>After the Genoese pilot’s narrative follows that of an anonymous
    Portuguese taken from Ramusio.</p>

  <p>The letter of Maximilian, the Transylvanian, follows Pigafetta’s
    account; this has been translated from the Latin by Mr. James Baynes,
    of the Printed Book <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">lvii</span>Department of the British Museum. After that comes
    the log-book of Francisco Albo or Alvaro, translated from a MS. in
    the British Museum, which is a copy from a document in Simancas. This
    log-book has been printed, in Navarrete’s collection, apparently from
    the British Museum MS., and it appears to have escaped the notice of
    Captain Burney. It is especially valuable because it helps to fix the
    position of the “Unfortunate Islands”, and because it establishes that
    the Island of Amsterdam in the Southern Indian Ocean to the North of
    St. Paul’s Island, the discovery of which is usually attributed to the
    Dutch navigator Vlaming, in 1696, was discovered March 18th, 1522, by
    the <cite>Victoria</cite>, the first ship which went round the world.</p>

  <p>There is a confusion as to the names of these two islands, which are
    rightly named in the Admiralty and other sea charts, but which are
    wrongly named in common English maps, which place St. Paul to the
    north of Amsterdam. The southern island is bare and arid, and the
    northern island has bushes and a high peak visible eighteen or twenty
    leagues off. Francisco Albo says this Island had no trees; but the
    <cite>Victoria</cite> may not have approached near enough to see the bushes,
    which, from the views of the island, appear to be near its base; it
    is clear that the <cite>Victoria</cite> approached the northern island, or
    Amsterdam, because not only does the latitude given by F. Albo differ
    from that of modern observation by only eight miles, but also because
    from the course steered by the <cite>Victoria</cite> on leaving this island,
    she must have sighted the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">lviii</span>northern island had the one discovered by
    her been the southern one. Plates are given of these two islands, taken
    from Valentyn’s Dutch work on the East Indies. A French Geographical
    Dictionary sets up a claim to these islands as belonging to the
    government of the Isle of France or Mauritius; it does not say on what
    grounds; but if ever they were dependencies of Mauritius, they will
    have passed with that island into the possession of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>Correa’s narrative contains two details not given in any of the other
    accounts, viz., the warning given to Magellan at Tenerife by Diogo
    Barbosa of the intended mutiny; and the incident of the Portuguese
    ship speaking the <cite>Victoria</cite> off the Cape of Good Hope. Correa’s
    having been in India at the time, and relating what he heard from the
    Portuguese, would account for his misplacing the death of Magellan
    as having happened at the same time as that of Duarte Barbosa. His
    narrative also contains additional evidence of the violent animosity of
    the Portuguese against Magellan, though he himself is more favourable
    than other Portuguese historians to him who is one of the most renowned
    of their countrymen, as he undoubtedly is the greatest of ancient and
    modern navigators.</p>

  <p>He sailed from Seville on the 10th day of August of the said year,
    and remained at the bar until the 21st day of September, and as soon
    as he got outside, he steered to the south-west to make the island of
    Tenerife, and they reached the said island on the day of St. Michael,
    which was the 29th of September.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Thence he made his course to fetch
    the Cape Verde islands, and they passed between the islands and the
    Cape without sighting either the one or the other. Having got as far
    as this neighbourhood, he shaped his course so as to make for Brazil,
    and as soon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to
    the south-east&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which is in
    twenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he steered to
    the west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de Janeiro, which
    is in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered the said Rio
    on the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in which place
    they took in wood, and they remained there until the first octave of
    Christmas, which was the 26th of December of the same year.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

  <p>They sailed from this Rio de Janeiro on the 26th December, and
    navigated along the coast to make the Cape of St. Mary, which is in
    thirty-four degrees and two-thirds; as soon as they sighted it, they
    made their course west-north-west, thinking they would find a passage
    for their voyage, and they found that they had got into a great
    river of fresh water, to which they gave the name of river of St.
    Christopher, and it is in thirty-four degrees, and they remained in it
    till the 2nd of February, 1520.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>He sailed from this river of St. Christopher on the 2nd of the said
    month of February; they navigated along the said coast, and further on
    to the south they discovered a point which is in the same river more
    to the south, to which they gave the name of Point St. Antony; it is
    in thirty-six degrees, hence they ran to the south-west, a matter of
    twenty-five leagues, and made another cape which they named Cape St.
    Apelonia, which is in thirty-six degrees; thence they navigated to the
    west-south-west to some shoals,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which they named Shoals of the
    Currents, which are in thirty-nine degrees; and thence they navigated
    out to sea, and lost sight of land for a matter of two or three days,
    when they again made for the land, and they came to a bay, which they
    entered, and ran within it the whole day, thinking that there was an
    outlet for Maluco, and when night came they found that it was quite
    closed up, and in the same night they again stood out by the way which
    they had come in. This bay is in thirty-four degrees;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> they name it
    the island&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of St. Matthew. They navigated from this island of St.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>Matthew along the coast until they reached another bay, where they
    caught many sea-wolves and birds; to this they gave the name of “Bay of
    Labours;”&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> it is in thirty-seven degrees; here they were near losing
    the flag-ship in a storm. Thence they navigated along the said coast,
    and arrived on the last day of March of the year 1520 at the Port of
    St. Julian, which is in forty-nine and one-third degrees,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and here
    they wintered, and found the day a little more or less than seven
    hours.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

  <p>In this port three of the ships rose up against the Captain-major,
    their captains saying that they intended to take him to Castile in
    arrest, as he was taking them all to destruction. Here, through the
    exertions of the said Captain-major, and the assistance and favour of
    the foreigners whom he carried with him, the Captain-major went to the
    said three ships which were already mentioned, and there the captain
    of one of them was killed, who was treasurer of the whole fleet, and
    named Luis de Mendoça; he was killed in his own ship&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> by stabs with
    a dagger by the chief constable of the fleet, who was sent to do this
    by Fernando de Magalhāes in a boat with certain men. The said three
    ships having thus been recovered, five days later Fernando de Magalhāes
    ordered Gaspar de Queixada to be decapitated and quartered; he was
    captain of one of the ships,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and was one of those who had mutinied.</p>

  <p>In this port they refitted the ship. Here the captain-major made Alvaro
    de Mesquita, a Portuguese,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> captain of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>one of the ships the captain
    of which had been killed. There sailed from this port on the 24th of
    August four ships, for the smallest of the ships had been already
    lost;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> he had sent it to reconnoitre, and the weather had been
    heavy, and had cast it ashore, where all the crew had been recovered
    along with the merchandise, artillery and fittings of the ship.
    They remained in this port, in which they wintered, five months and
    twenty-four days,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and they were seventy degrees less ten minutes to
    the southward.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

  <p>They sailed on the 24th day of the month of August of the said year
    from this port of St. Julian and navigated a matter of twenty leagues
    along the coast, and so they entered a river which was called Santa
    Cruz, which is in fifty degrees,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> where they took in goods and as
    much as they could obtain: the crew of the lost ship were already
    distributed among the other ships, for they had returned by land
    to where Fernando de Magalhāes was, and they continued collecting
    the goods which had remained there during August and up to the 18th
    September, and there they took in water and much fish which they caught
    in this river; and in the other, where <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>they wintered, there were
    people like savages, and the men are from nine to ten spans in height,
    very well made; they have not got houses, they only go about from one
    place to another with their flocks, and eat meat nearly raw: they are
    all of them archers and kill many animals with arrows, and with the
    skins they make clothes, that is to say, they make the skins very
    supple, and fashion them after the shape of the body, as well as they
    can, then they cover themselves with them, and fasten them by a belt
    round the waist. When they do not wish to be clothed from the waist
    upwards, they let that half fall which is above the waist, and the
    garment remains hanging down from the belt which they have girt round
    them.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> They wear shoes which cover them four inches above the ankle,
    full of straw inside to keep their feet warm. They do not possess any
    iron, nor any other ingenuity of weapons, only they make the points
    of their arrows with flints, and so also the knives with which they
    cut, and the adze and awls with which they cut and stitch their shoes
    and clothes. They are very agile people, and do no harm, and thus they
    follow their flocks: wherever night finds them there they sleep; they
    carry their wives along with them with all the chattels which they
    possess. The women are very small and carry heavy burdens on their
    backs; they wear shoes and clothes just like the men. Of these men they
    obtained three or four and brought them in the ships, and they all died
    except one, who went to Castile in a ship which went thither.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

  <p>They sailed from this river of Santa Cruz on the 18th of October:&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
    they continued navigating along the coast until <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>the 21st day of the
    same month, October, when they discovered a cape, to which they gave
    the name of Cape of the Virgins, because they sighted it on the day of
    the eleven thousand virgins; it is in fifty-two degrees, a little more
    or less, and from this cape a matter of two or three leagues distance,
    we found ourselves at the mouth of a strait.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> We sailed along the
    said coast within that strait which they had reached the mouth of:
    they entered in it a little and anchored. Fernando de Magalhāes sent
    to discover what there was further in, and they found three channels,
    that is to say, two more in a southerly direction, and one traversing
    the country in the direction of Maluco, but at that time <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>this was not
    yet known, only the three mouths were seen. The boats went thither,
    and brought back word, and they set sail and anchored at these mouths
    of the channels, and Fernando de Magalhāes sent two ships to learn
    what there was within, and these ships went: one returned to the
    Captain-major, and the other, of which Alvaro de Mesquita was captain,
    entered into one of the bays which was to the south, and did not return
    any more. Fernan de Magalhāes seeing that it did not come back, set
    sail,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the next day he did not choose to make for the bays,
    and went to the south, and took another which runs north-west and
    south-east, and a quarter west and east. He left letters in the place
    from which he sailed, so that if the other ship returned, it might
    make the course which he left prescribed. After this they entered into
    the channel, which at some places has a width of three leagues, and
    two, and one, and in some places half a league, and he went through
    it as long as it was daylight, and anchored when it was night: and he
    sent the boats, and the ships went after the boats, and they brought
    news that there was an outlet, for they already saw the great sea on
    the other side; on which account Fernando <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>de Magalhāes ordered much
    artillery to be fired for rejoicing;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and before they went forth
    from this strait they found two islands, the first one larger, and the
    other nearer towards the outlet is the smaller one: and they went out
    between these islands and the coast on the southern side, as it was
    deeper than on the other side. This strait is a hundred leagues in
    length to the outlet; that outlet and the entrance are in fifty-two
    degrees latitude.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> They made a stay in this strait from the 21st
    October to the 26th of November,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>which makes thirty-six days of
    the said year of 1520, and as soon as they went out from the strait to
    sea, they made their course, for the most part, to west-north-west,
    when they found that their needles varied to the north-west almost
    two-fourths, and after they had navigated thus for many days, they
    found an island in a little more or less than eighteen degrees, or
    nineteen degrees, and also another, which was in from thirteen to
    fourteen degrees, and this in south latitude;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> they are uninhabited.
    They ran on until they reached the line, when Fernan de Magalhāes
    said that now they were in the neighbourhood of Maluco, as he had
    information that there were no provisions at Maluco, he said that he
    would go in a northerly direction as far as ten or twelve degrees, and
    they reached to as far as thirteen degrees north, and in this latitude
    they navigated to the west, and a quarter south-west, a matter of a
    hundred leagues, where on the 6th of March, 1521, they fetched two
    islands inhabited by many people, and they anchored at one of them,
    which is in twelve degrees north; and the inhabitants are people of
    little truth, and they did not take precautions against them until they
    saw that they were taking away the skiff of the flagship, and they cut
    the rope with which it was made fast, and took it ashore without their
    being able to prevent it. They gave this island the name of Thieves’
    Island (<i>dos ladrōes</i>).&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

  <p>Fernando de Magalhāes seeing that the skiff was lost, set sail, as
    it was already night, tacking about until the next day; as soon as it
    was morning they anchored at the place where they had seen the skiff
    carried off to, and he ordered two boats to be got ready with a matter
    of fifty or sixty men, and he went ashore in person, and burned the
    whole village, and they killed seven or eight persons, between men and
    women, and recovered the skiff, and returned to the ships; and while
    they were there they saw forty or fifty paros&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> come, which came from
    the same land, and brought much refreshments.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

  <p>Fernan de Magalhāes would not make any further stay, and at once
    set sail, and ordered the course to be steered west, and a quarter
    south-west; and so they made land, which is in barely eleven degrees.
    This land is an island, but he would not touch at this one, and they
    went to touch at another further on which appeared first.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Fernando
    de Magalhāes sent a boat ashore to observe the nature of the island;
    when the boat reached land, they saw from the ships two <i>paráos</i>
    come out from behind the point; then they called back their boat. The
    people of the paraos seeing that the boat was returning to the ships,
    turned back the paraos, and the boat reached the ships, which at once
    set sail for another island very near to this island, which is in ten
    degrees, and they gave it the name of the island of Good Signs, because
    they found some gold in it.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Whilst <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>they were thus anchored at
    this island, there came to them two paráos, and brought them fowls and
    cocoa nuts, and told them that they had already seen there other men
    like them, from which they presumed that these might be <i>Lequios</i>
    or <i>Mogores</i>;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a nation of people who have this name, or
    <i>Chiis</i>;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and thence they set sail, and navigated further on
    amongst many islands, to which they gave the name of the <em>Valley
    Without Peril</em>, and also St. Lazarus,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and they ran on to another
    island twenty leagues from that&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> from which they sailed, which is
    in ten degrees,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and came to anchor at another island, which is
    named Macangor,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> which is in nine degrees; and in this island they
    were very well received, and they placed a cross in it.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This king
    conducted them thence a matter of thirty leagues to another island
    named Cabo,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>which is in ten degrees, and in this island Fernando
    de Magalhāes did what he pleased with the consent of the country, and
    in one day eight hundred people became Christian, on which account
    Fernan de Magalhāes desired that the other kings, neighbours to this
    one, should become subject to this who had become Christian: and these
    did not choose to yield such obedience. Fernan de Magalhāes seeing
    that, got ready one night with his boats, and burned the villages of
    those who would not yield the said obedience;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and a matter of ten
    or twelve days after this was done he sent to a village about half
    a league from that which he had burned, which is named Matam, and
    which is also an island, and ordered them to send him at once three
    goats, three pigs, three loads of rice, and three loads of millet for
    provisions for the ships; they replied that of each article which he
    sent to ask them three of, they would send to him by twos, and if he
    was satisfied with this they would at once comply, if not, it might be
    as he pleased, but that they would not give it. Because they did not
    choose to grant what he demanded of them, Fernan de Magalhāes ordered
    three boats to be equipped with a matter of fifty or sixty men,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and
    went against the said place, which was on the 28th day of April, in the
    morning;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> there they found many people, who might well be as many as
    three thousand or four thousand men, who fought with such a good will
    that the said Fernan de Magalhāes was killed there, with six of his
    men,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in the year 1521.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

  <p>When Fernan de Magalhāes was dead the Christians got back to the
    ships, where they thought fit to make two captains and governors whom
    they should obey;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and having done this, they took counsel [and
    decided] that the two captains should go ashore where the people had
    turned Christians to ask for pilots to take them to Borneo, and this
    was on the first day of May of the said year; when the two captains
    went, being agreed upon what had been said, the same people of the
    country who had become Christians, armed themselves against them, and
    whilst they reached the shore let them land in security as they had
    done before. Then they attacked them, and killed the two captains
    and twenty-six gentlemen,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and the other people who remained got
    back to the boats, and returned to the ships, and finding themselves
    again without captains they agreed, inasmuch as the principal persons
    were killed, that one Joam Lopez,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who was the chief treasurer,
    should be captain-major of the fleet, and the chief <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>constable of the
    fleet should be captain of one of the ships; he was named Gonzalo Vaz
    Despinosa.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

  <p>Having done this they set sail, and ran about twenty-five leagues with
    three ships, which they still possessed; they then mustered, and found
    that they were altogether one hundred and eight men&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in all these
    three ships, and many of them were wounded and sick, on which account
    they did not venture to navigate the three ships, and thought it would
    be well to burn one of them—the one that should be most suitable for
    that purpose&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>—and to take into the two ships those that remained:
    this they did out at sea, out of sight of any land. While they did
    this many paraos came to speak to them; and navigating amongst the
    islands, for in that neighbourhood there are a great many, they did not
    understand one another, for they had no interpreter, for he had been
    killed with Fernan de Magalhāes. Sailing further on amongst islets they
    came to anchor at an island which is named Carpyam,[4] where there is
    gold enough, and this island is in fully eight degrees.</p>

  <p>Whilst at anchor in this port of Capyam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> they had speech with the
    inhabitants of the island, and made peace with them, and Carvalho,
    who was captain-major, gave them the boat of the ship which had been
    burnt: this island has three&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> islets in the offing; here they took
    in some refreshments, and sailed further on to west south-west, and
    fell in with another island, which is named Caram, and is in eleven
    degrees; from this they went on further to west south-west,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>and
    fell in with a large island, and ran along the coast of this island to
    the north-east,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and reached as far as nine degrees and a half,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
    where they went ashore one day, with the boats equipped to seek for
    provisions, for in the ships there was now not more than for eight
    days. On reaching shore the inhabitants would not suffer them to land,
    and shot at them with arrows of cane hardened in the fire, so that they
    returned to the ships.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, they agreed to go to another island, where they had had
    some dealings, to see if they could get some provisions. Then they met
    with a contrary wind, and going about a league in the direction in
    which they wished to go, they anchored, and whilst at anchor they saw
    that people on shore were hailing them to go thither; they went there
    with the boats, and as they were speaking to those people by signs,
    for they did not understand each other otherwise, a man at arms, named
    Joam de Campos, told them to let him go on shore, since there were
    no provisions in the ships, and it might be that they would obtain
    some means of getting provisions; and that if the people killed him,
    they would not lose much with him, for God would take thought of his
    soul; and also if he found provisions, and if they did not kill him,
    he would find means for bringing them to the ships: and they thought
    well of this. So he went on shore, and as soon as he reached it, the
    inhabitants received him, and took him into the interior the distance
    of a league, and when he was in the village all the people came to see
    him, and they gave him food, and entertained him well, especially when
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>they saw that he ate pig’s flesh; because in this island they had
    dealings with the Moors of Borneo, and because the country and people
    were greedy, they made them neither eat pigs nor bring them up in the
    country. This country is called Dyguasam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and is in nine degrees.</p>

  <p>The said Christian seeing that he was favoured and well treated by the
    inhabitants, gave them to understand by his signs that they should
    carry provisions to the ships, which would be well paid for. In the
    country there was nothing except rice not pounded. Then the people set
    to pounding rice all the night, and when it was morning they took the
    rice and the said Christian, and came to the ships, where they did them
    great honour, and took in the rice and paid them, and they returned
    on shore. This man being already set on shore, inhabitants of another
    village, a little further on, came to the ships and told them to go to
    their village, and that they would give them much provisions for their
    money; and as soon as the said man whom they had sent arrived, they set
    sail and went to anchor at the village of those who had come to call
    them, which was named Vay Palay Cucara Canbam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> where Carvalho made
    peace with the king of the country, and they settled the price of the
    rice, and they gave them two measures of rice which weighed one hundred
    and fourteen pounds&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> for three fathoms of linen stuff of Britanny;
    they took there as much rice as they wanted, and goats and pigs, and
    whilst they were at this place there came a Moor, who had been in the
    village <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>of Dyguaçam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> which belongs to the Moors of Borneo, as has
    been said above, and after that he went to his country.</p>

  <p>While they were at anchor near this village of Diguaçam,&NoBreak;<a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> there came
    to them a parao in which there was a negro named Bastiam, who asked for
    a flag and a passport for the governor of Diguaçam, and they gave him
    all this and other things as a present. They asked the said Bastiam,
    who spoke Portuguese sufficiently well, since he had been in Maluco,
    where he became a Christian, if he would go with them and shew them
    Borneo; he said he would very willingly, and when the departure arrived
    he hid himself, and seeing that he did not come, they set sail from
    this port of Diguaçam on the 21st day of July&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to seek for Borneo.
    As they set sail there came to them a parao, which was coming to the
    port of Diguaçam, and they took it, and in it they took three Moors,
    who said they were pilots, and that they would take them to Borneo.</p>

  <p>Having got these Moors, they steered along this island to the
    south-west, and fell in with two islands at its extremity, and passed
    between them; that on the north side is named Bolyna, and that on the
    south Bamdym.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Sailing to the west south-west a matter of fourteen
    leagues, they fell in with a white bottom, which was a shoal below
    the water, and the black men they carried with them told them to draw
    near to the coast of the island, as it was deeper there, and that
    was more in the direction of Borneo, for from that neighbourhood the
    island of Borneo could already be sighted. This same day they reached
    and anchored at some islands, to which they gave the name of islets
    of St. Paul, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>was a matter of two and a half or three leagues
    from the great island of Borneo, and they were in about seven degrees
    at the south side of these islands. In the island of Borneo there is
    an exceedingly great mountain, to which they gave the name of Mount
    St. Paul; and from thence they navigated along the coast of Borneo to
    the south-west, between an island and the island of Borneo itself; and
    they went forward on the same course and reached the neighbourhood of
    Borneo,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and the Moors whom they had with them told them that there
    was Borneo, and the wind did not suffer them to arrive thither, as it
    was contrary. They anchored at an island which is there, and which may
    be eight leagues from Borneo.</p>

  <p>Close to this island is another which has many myrobolans, and the
    next day they set sail for the other island, which is nearer to the
    port of Borneo; and going along thus they saw so many shoals that
    they anchored, and sent the boats ashore in Borneo, and they took the
    aforesaid Moorish pilots on shore, and there went a Christian with
    them; and the boats went to set them on land, from whence they had to
    go to the city of Borneo, which was three leagues off, and there they
    were taken before the Shahbender of Borneo, and he asked what people
    they were, and for what they came in the ships; and they were presented
    to the King of Borneo with the Christian. As soon as the boats had set
    the said men on shore, they sounded in order to see if the ships could
    come in closer: and during this they saw three junks which were coming
    from the port of Borneo from the said city out to sea, and as soon as
    they saw the ships they returned inshore: continuing to sound, they
    found the channel by which the port is entered; they then set sail, and
    entered this channel, and being within the channel they anchored, and
    would not go further in until they received a message from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>the shore,
    which arrived next day with two paraos: these carried certain swivel
    guns of metal, and a hundred men in each parao, and they brought goats
    and fowls, and two cows, and figs, and other fruit, and told them to
    enter further in opposite the islands which were near there, which
    was the true berth; and from this position to the city there might be
    three or four leagues. Whilst thus at anchor they established peace,
    and settled that they should trade in what there was in the country,
    especially wax, to which they answered that they would willingly sell
    all that there was in the country for their money. This port of Borneo
    is in eight degrees.</p>

  <p>For the answer thus received from the King they sent him a present by
    Gonzalo Mendes Despinosa,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> captain of the ship Victoria, and the
    King accepted the present, and gave to all of them China stuffs: and
    when there had passed twenty or twenty-three days that they were there
    trading with the people of the island, and had got five men on shore in
    the city itself, there came to anchor at the bar, close to them, five
    junks, at the hour of vespers, and they remained there that evening
    and the night until next day in the morning, when they saw coming from
    the city two hundred paraos, some under sail, others rowing. Seeing in
    this manner the five junks and the paraos, it seemed to them that there
    might be treachery, and they set sail for the junks, and as soon as the
    crews of the junks saw them under sail, they also set sail and made off
    where the wind best served them; and they overhauled one of the junks
    with the boats, and took it with twenty-seven men;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the ships
    went and anchored abreast of the island of the Myrololans, with the
    junk made fast to the poop of the flagship, and the paraos returned to
    shore, and when night came there came on a squall from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>west in
    which the said junk went to the bottom alongside the flagship, without
    being able to receive any assistance from it.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

  <p>Next day in the morning they saw a sail, and went to it and took it;
    this was a great junk in which the son of the King of Lucam came as
    captain, and had with him ninety men, and as soon as they took them
    they sent some of them to the King of Borneo; and they sent him word
    by these men to send the Christians whom they had got there, who were
    seven men, and they would give him all the people whom they had taken
    in the junk; on which account the King sent two men of the seven whom
    he had got there in a parao, and they again sent him word to send the
    five men who still remained, and they would send all the people whom
    they had got from the junk. They waited two days for the answer, and
    there came no message; then they took thirty men from the junk, and
    put them into a parao belonging to the junk, and sent them to the King
    of Borneo, and set sail with fourteen men of those they had taken and
    three women; and they steered along the coast of the said island to
    the north-east, returning backwards; and they again passed between the
    islands and the great island of Borneo, where the flagship grounded on
    a point of the island, and so remained more than four hours, and the
    tide turned and it got off, by which it was seen clearly that the tide
    was of twenty-four hours.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

  <p>Whilst making the aforesaid course the wind shifted to north-east,
    and they stood out to sea, and they saw a sail coming, and the ships
    anchored, and the boats went to it and took it; it was a small junk and
    carried nothing but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>cocoa-nuts; and they took in water and wood, and
    set sail along the coast of the island to the north-east, until they
    reached the extremity of the said island, and met with another small
    island, where they overhauled the ships. They arrived at this island on
    the day of our Lady of August, and in it they found a very good point
    for beaching the ships, and they gave it the name of Port St. Mary of
    August, and it is in fully seven degrees.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had taken these precautions they set sail and steered
    to the south-west until they sighted the island which is named
    Fagajam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and this is a course of thirty-eight to forty leagues: and
    as soon as they sighted this island they steered to the south-west,
    and again made an island which is called Seloque,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and they had
    information that there were many pearls there: and when they had
    already sighted that island the wind shifted to a head-wind, and they
    could not fetch it by the course they were sailing, and it seemed to
    them that it might be in six degrees. This same night they arrived at
    the island of Quipe, and ran along it to the south-east, and passed
    between it and another island called Tamgym,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and always running
    along the coast of the said island, and going thus, they fell in with
    a parao laden with sago in loaves, which is bread made of a tree which
    is named cajare,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which the people of that country eat as bread.
    This parao carried twenty-one men, and the chief of them had been in
    Maluco in the house of Francisco Serram, and having gone further along
    this island they arrived in sight of some islands which are named
    Semrryn;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> they are in five degrees, a little more or less. The
    inhabitants of this land came to see the ships, and so they had speech
    of one another, and an old man of these people told them that he would
    conduct them to Maluco.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

  <p>In this manner, having fixed a time with the old man, an agreement was
    made with him, and they gave him a certain price for this; and when the
    next day came, and they were to depart, the old man intended to escape,
    and they understood it, and took him and others who were with him, and
    who also said that they knew pilot’s work, and they set sail; and as
    soon as the inhabitants saw them go they fitted out to go after them:
    and of these paraos there did not reach the ships more than two, and
    these reached so near that they shot arrows into the ships, and the
    wind was fresh&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and they could not come up with them. At midnight of
    that day they sighted some islands, and they steered more towards them;
    and next day they saw land, which was an island; and at night following
    that day they found themselves very close to it, and when night fell
    the wind calmed and the currents drew them very much inshore; there the
    old pilot cast himself into the sea, and betook himself to land.</p>

  <p>Sailing thus forward, after one of the pilots had fled, they sighted
    another island and arrived close to it, and another Moorish pilot said
    that Maluco was still further on, and navigating thus, the next day
    in the morning they sighted three high mountains, which belonged to a
    nation of people whom they called the Salabos;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and then they saw
    a small island where they anchored to take in some water, and because
    they feared that in Maluco they would not be allowed to take it in;
    and they omitted doing so, because the Moorish pilot told them that
    there were some four hundred&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> men in that island, and that they
    were all very bad, and might do them some injury, as they were men
    of little faith; and that he would give them no such advice as to go
    to that island; and also because Maluco, which they were seeking,
    was now <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>near, and that its kings were good men, who gave a good
    reception to all sorts of men in their country; and while still in
    this neighbourhood&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> they saw the islands themselves of Maluco, and
    for rejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the
    island&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> on the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from
    Seville to Maluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they
    sailed on the 10th of August of 1519.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

  <p>As soon as they arrived at the island of Tydor,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> which is in half
    a degree, the King thereof did them great honour, which could not be
    exceeded: there they treated with the King for their cargo, and the
    King engaged to give them a cargo and whatever there was in the country
    for their money, and they settled to give for the bahar of cloves
    fourteen ells of yellow cloth of twenty-seven tem,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> which are worth
    in Castile a ducat the ell; of red cloth of the same kind ten ells;
    they also gave thirty ells of Brittany linen cloth, and for each of
    these quantities they received a bahar of cloves, likewise for thirty
    knives eight bahars:&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> having thus settled all the above mentioned
    prices, the inhabitants of the country gave them information that
    further on, in another island near, there was a Portuguese man. This
    island might be two leagues distant, and it was named Targatell;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
    this man was the chief person of Maluco; <em>there we now have got a
    fortress</em>.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> They then wrote letters to the said Portuguese, to
    come and speak with them, to which he answered that he did not dare,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>because the King of the country forbade it; that if they obtained
    permission from the King he would come at once; this permission they
    soon got, and the Portuguese came to speak with them.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> They gave
    him an account of the prices which they had settled, at which he was
    amazed, and said that on that account the King had ordered him not to
    come, as they did not know the truth about the prices of the country;
    and whilst they were thus taking in cargo there arrived the King of
    Baraham,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> which is near there, and said that he wished to be a
    vassal of the King of Castile, and also that he had got four hundred
    bahars of cloves, and that he had sold it to the King of Portugal, and
    that they had bought it, but that he had not yet delivered it, and if
    they wished for it, he would give it all to them; to which the captains
    answered that if he brought it to them, and came with it, they would
    buy it, but otherwise not. The King, seeing that they did not wish to
    take the cloves, asked them for a flag and a letter of safe conduct,
    which they gave him, signed by the captains of the ships.</p>

  <p>While they were thus waiting for the cargo, it seemed to them, from
    the delay in the delivery, that the King was preparing some treachery
    against them, and the greater part of the ships’ crews made an uproar
    and told the captains to go, as the delays which the King made were
    for nothing else than treachery: as it seemed to them all that it
    might be so, they were abandoning everything, and were intending to
    depart; and being about to unfurl the sails, the King, who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>had made
    the agreement with them, came to the flagship and asked the captain
    why he wanted to go, because that which he had agreed upon with him he
    intended to fulfil it as had been settled. The captain replied that the
    ships’ crews said they should go and not remain any longer, as it was
    only treachery that was being prepared against them. To this the King
    answered that it was not so, and on that account he at once sent for
    his Koran, upon which he wished to make oath that nothing such should
    be done to them. They at once brought him this Koran, and upon it he
    made oath, and told them to rest at ease with that. At this the crews
    were set at rest, and he promised them that he would give them their
    cargo by the 15th December 1521, which he fulfilled within the said
    time without being wanting in anything.</p>

  <p>When the two ships were already laden and about to unfurl their sails,
    the flagship&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> sprung a large leak, and the King of the country
    learning this, he sent them twenty-five divers&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> to stop the leak,
    which they were unable to do. They settled that the other ship should
    depart, and that this one should again discharge all its cargo, and
    unload it; and as they could not stop the leak, that they [the people
    of the country] should give them all that they might be in need of.
    This was done, and they discharged the cargo of the flagship; and when
    the said ship was repaired, they took in her cargo, and decided on
    making for the country of the Antilles, and the course from Maluco to
    it was 2,000 leagues a little more or less. The other ship, which set
    sail first, left on the 21st of December of the said year, and went out
    to sea for Timor, and made its course behind Java, 2,055 leagues to the
    Cape of Good Hope.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

  <p>They refitted the ship, and took in the cargo in four months and
    sixteen days: they sailed on the 6th of April of the year 1522, and
    took their course for the mainland of the Antilles by the strait
    through which they had come; and at first they navigated to the North,
    until they came out from the islands of Ternate and Tymor;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
    afterwards they navigated along the island of Betachina, ten or eleven
    leagues to the North-east;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> after that they steered about twenty
    leagues to the North-east, and so arrived at an island, which is
    named Doyz,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and is in three and a half degrees South latitude
    at its South-eastern side: from this place they navigated three or
    four leagues eastwards, and sighted two islands, one large and the
    other small; the large one was named Porquenampello,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and passed
    between it and Batechina, which lay on their starboard side. They
    reached a cape, to which they gave the name Cape of Palms, because
    they sighted it on the vigil of Palms. This cape is in two and a half
    degrees: thence they steered to the South to make Quimar,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> which
    is land belonging to the King of Tydor, and the said King had ordered
    that they should receive whatever there was in the country for their
    money, and there they took pigs and goats, and fowls and cocoa-nuts and
    <i>hava</i>:&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> they remained in this port eight or nine days. This
    port of Camarfya&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> is in one and a quarter degree.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>They sailed from this port on the 20th&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> of April, and steered
    for about seventeen leagues,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and came out of the channel of
    the island of Batechina and the island Charam;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and as soon as
    they were outside, they saw that the said island of Charam&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> ran
    to the South-east a good eighteen or twenty leagues, and it was not
    their course, for their direction was to the East&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and a quarter
    North-east; and they navigated in the said course some days, and always
    found the winds very contrary for their course. On the 3rd of May they
    made two small islands, which might be in five degrees more or less,
    to which they gave the name of islands of St. Antony.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Thence they
    navigated further on to the North-east, and arrived at an island which
    is named Cyco,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> which is in fully nineteen degrees, and they made
    this island on the 11th of July.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> From this island they took a
    man, whom they carried away with them, and they navigated further on,
    tacking about with contrary winds, until they reached forty-two degrees
    North latitude.</p>

  <p>When they were in this neighbourhood, they were short of bread, wine,
    meat, and oil; they had nothing to eat only water and rice, without
    other provisions; and the cold was great, and they had not sufficient
    covering, the crews began to die, and seeing themselves in this
    state, they decided on putting back in the direction of Maluco, which
    they at once carried into effect. When at a distance of five hundred
    leagues from it, they desired to make the island which is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>named
    Quamgragam,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and as they sighted it at night, they did not choose
    to make it; they waited thus till it dawned next day, and they were
    unable to fetch the said island; and the man whom they carried with
    them, and whom before they had taken from that island, told them to go
    further on, and they would make three islands, where there was a good
    port, and this which the black man said, was in order to run away at
    them, as indeed he did run away. On arriving at these three islands,
    they fetched them with some danger, and anchored in the middle of them
    in fifteen fathoms. Of these islands, the largest was inhabited by
    twenty persons between men and women: this island is named Pamo;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
    it is in twenty degrees more or less: here they took in rain-water, as
    there was no other in the country. In this island the black man&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
    ran away. Thence they sailed to make the land of Camafo, and as soon
    as they sighted it they had calms, and the currents carried them
    away from the land; and afterwards they had a little wind, and they
    made for the land, but could not fetch it; they then went to anchor
    between the islands of Domi and Batechina, and while at anchor, a
    parao passed by them with some men who belonged to the King of an
    island named Geilôlo,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and they gave them news that the Portuguese
    were in Maluco making a fortress. Learning this, they at once sent
    the clerk of the ship with certain men&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> to the captain-major of
    those Portuguese, who was named Antonio de Bryto, to ask him to come
    and bring the ship to the place where they were; because the crew
    of the ship had mostly died, and the rest were sick, and could not
    navigate the ship. As soon as Antonio de Bryto saw the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>letter and
    message, he sent down Dom Gonzalo&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Amriquiz, captain of the ship
    Sam Jorge,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and also a fusta with some country parāos, and they
    went thus in search of the ship, and having found it, they brought it
    to the fortress, and whilst they were discharging its cargo, there came
    a squall from the north,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> which cast it on shore. Where this ship
    turned to put back to Maluco was a little more or less than 1050 or
    1100 leagues from the island.</p>

  <p class="p2">This was transcribed from the paper-book of a Genoese pilot, who came
    in the said ship, who wrote all the voyage as it is here. He went to
    Portugal in the year 1524 with Dom Amriqui de Menezes.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Thanks be

  </div>

  <p>In the name of God and of good salvation. We departed from Seville
    with five ships on the tenth of August, in the year 1519, to go and
    discover the Molucca Islands. We commenced our voyage from San Lucar
    for the Canary Islands, and sailed south-west 960 miles, where we found
    ourselves at the island of Tenerife, in which is the harbour of Santa
    Cruz in twenty-eight degrees of north latitude. And from the island
    of Tenerife we sailed southwards 1680 miles, when we found ourselves
    in four degrees of north latitude. From these four degrees of north
    latitude we sailed south-west, until we found ourselves at the Cape of
    Saint Augustin, which is in eight degrees of south latitude, having
    accomplished 1200 miles. And from Cape Saint Augustin we sailed south
    and by south-west 864 miles, where we found ourselves in twenty degrees
    of south latitude. From twenty degrees of south latitude, being at
    sea, we sailed 1500 miles south-west, when we found ourselves near
    the river, whose mouth is 108 miles wide, and lies in thirty-five
    degrees of the said south latitude. We named it the river of Saint
    Christopher. From this river we sailed 1638 miles south-west by west,
    where we found ourselves at the point of the Lupi Marini, which is in
    forty-eight degrees of south latitude. And from the point of the Lupi
    Marini we sailed south-west 350 miles, where we found ourselves in the
    harbour of Saint Julian, and stayed there five months waiting for the
    sun to return towards us, because in June and July it appeared for
    only four hours each day. From this harbour of Saint Julian, which is
    in fifty degrees, we departed on the 24th of August, 1520, and sailed
    westward a hundred miles, where we found a river to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>which we gave the
    name of River of Santa Cruz, and there we remained until the 18th of
    October. This river is in fifty degrees. We departed thence on the 18th
    of October, and sailed along the coast 378 miles south-west by west,
    where we found ourselves in a strait, to which we gave the name Strait
    of Victoria, because the ship <cite>Victoria</cite> was the first that had
    seen it: some called it the Strait of Magalhaens, because our captain
    was named Fernando de Magalhaens. The mouth of this strait is in
    fifty-three degrees and a half, and we sailed through it 400 miles to
    the other mouth, which is in the same latitude of fifty-three degrees
    and a half. We emerged from this strait on the 27th of November, 1520,
    and sailed between west and north-west 9858 miles, until we found
    ourselves upon the equinoctial line. In this course we found two
    uninhabited islands, the one of which was distant from the other 800
    miles. To the first we gave the name of Saint Peter, and to the other
    the island of the Tiburones. Saint Peter is in eighteen degrees, the
    island of the Tiburones in fourteen degrees of south latitude. From
    the equinoctial line we sailed between west and north-west 2046 miles,
    and discovered several islands between ten and twelve degrees of north
    latitude. In these islands there were many naked people as well men
    as women, we gave the islands the name of the Ladrones, because the
    people had robbed our ship: but it cost them very dear. I shall not
    relate further the course that we made, because we lengthened it not
    a little. But I will tell you that to go direct from these islands of
    the Ladrones to the Moluccas it is necessary to sail south-west a 1000
    miles, and there occur many islands, to which we gave the name of the
    Archipelago of Saint Lazarus. A little further there are the islands
    of the Moluccas, of which there are five, namely, Ternate, Tidor,
    Molir, Machiam, Bachian. In Ternate the Portuguese had built a very
    strong castle before I left. From the Molucca Islands to the islands of
    Banda there are three hundred miles, and one goes thither by different
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>courses, because there are many islands in between, and one must sail
    by sight. In these islands until you reach the islands of Banda, which
    are in four degrees and a half of south latitude, there are collected
    from thirty to forty thousand cantaros of nutmegs annually, and there
    is likewise collected much mastic; and if you wish to go to Calicut
    you must always sail amidst the islands as far as Malacca, which is
    distant from the Moluccas 2000 miles, and from Malacca to Calicut are
    2000 miles more. From Calicut to Portugal there are 14,000 miles. If
    from the islands of Banda you wish to round the Cape of Good Hope,
    you must sail between west and south-west until you find yourself in
    thirty-four degrees and a half of south latitude, and from there you
    sail westward, always keeping a good look-out at the prow not to run
    aground on the said Cape of Good Hope or its neighbourhood. From this
    Cape of Good Hope one sails north-west by west 2400 miles, and there
    finds the island of Saint Helena, where Portuguese ships go to take in
    water and wood, and other things. This island is in sixteen degrees
    south latitude, and there is no habitation except that of a Portuguese
    man, who has but one hand and one foot, no nose, and no ears, and is
    called Fornam-lopem.</p>

  <p>Sailing 1600 miles north-west from this island of Saint Helena you will
    find yourself upon the equinoctial line: from which line you will sail
    3534 miles north-west by north, until you find yourself in thirty-nine
    degrees north latitude. And if you wish to go from these thirty-nine
    degrees to Lisbon you will sail 950 miles eastward, where you will find
    the islands of the Azores, of which there are seven, namely, Terceira,
    San Jorge, Pico, Fayal, Graciosa, on the east, the island of Saint
    Michael, and the island of Saint Mary, all are between thirty-seven and
    forty degrees of north latitude. From the island of Terceira you will
    then sail eastward 1100 miles, where you will find yourself on the land
    of Lisbon.</p>

  <p>Since there are several curious persons (very illustrious and very
    reverend lord) who not only are pleased to listen to and learn the
    great and wonderful things which God has permitted me to see and suffer
    in the long and perilous navigation, which I have performed (and which
    is written hereafter), but also they desire to learn the methods and
    fashions of the road which I have taken in order to go thither, [and
    who do] not grant firm belief to the end unless they are first well
    advised and assured of the commencement. Therefore, my lord, it will
    please you to hear that finding myself in Spain in the year of the
    Nativity of our Lord, one thousand five hundred and nineteen, at the
    court of the most serene king&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> of the Romans, with the reverend
    lord, Mons. Francis Cheregato,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> then apostolic proto-notary,
    and ambassador of the Pope Leon the Tenth, who, through his virtue,
    afterwards arrived at the bishoprick of Aprutino and the principality
    of Theramo, and knowing both by the reading of many books and by the
    report of many lettered and well-informed persons who conversed with
    the said proto-notary, the very great and awful things of the ocean, I
    deliberated, with the favour <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>of the Emperor and the above-named lord,
    to experiment and go and see with my eyes a part of those things. By
    which means I could satisfy the desire of the said lords, and mine own
    also. So that it might be said that I had performed the said voyage,
    and seen well with my eyes the things hereafter written.</p>

  <p>Now in order to decypher the commencement of my voyage (very
    illustrious lord); having heard that there was in the city of Seville,
    a small armade to the number of five ships, ready to perform this long
    voyage, that is to say, to find the islands of Maluco, from whence
    the spices come: of which armade the captain-general was Fernand de
    Magaglianes, a Portuguese gentleman, commander of <cite>St. James of the
    Sword</cite>, who had performed several voyages in the ocean sea (in
    which he had behaved very honourably as a good man), I set out with
    many others in my favour from Barcelona, where at the time the Emperor
    was, and came by sea as far as Malaga, and thence I went away by land
    until I arrived at the said city of Seville. There I remained for
    the space of three months, waiting till the said armade was in order
    and readiness to perform its voyage. And because (very illustrious
    lord) that on the return from the said voyage, on going to Rome
    towards the holiness of our Holy Father,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> I found your lordship at
    Monterosa,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> where of your favour you gave me a good reception, and
    afterwards gave me to understand that you desired to have in writing
    the things which God of His grace had permitted me to see in my said
    voyage; therefore to satisfy and accede to your desire,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> I have
    reduced into this small book the principal things, in the best manner
    that I have been able.</p>

  <p>Finally (very illustrious lord), after all provisions had been made,
    and the vessels were in order, the captain-general, a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>discreet and
    virtuous man, careful of his honour, would not commence his voyage
    without first making some good and wholesome ordinances, such as it is
    the good custom to make for those who go to sea. Nevertheless he did
    not entirely declare the voyage which he was going to make, so that
    his men should not from amazement and fear be unwilling to accompany
    him on so long a voyage, as he had undertaken in his intention.
    Considering the great and impetuous storms&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> which are on the ocean
    sea, where I wished to go; and for another reason also, that is to say
    that the masters and captains of the other ships of his company did
    not love him: of this I do not know the reason, except by cause of
    his, the captain-general, being Portuguese, and they were Spaniards or
    Castilians, who for a long time have been in rivalry and ill will with
    one another. Notwithstanding this all were obedient to him. He made his
    ordinances such as those which follow, so that during the storms at
    sea, which often come on by night and day, his ships should not go away
    and separate from one another. These ordinances he published and made
    over in writing to each master of the ships, and commanded them to be
    observed and inviolably kept, unless there were great and legitimate
    excuses, and appearance of not having been able to do otherwise.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the said captain-general willed that the vessel in which he
    himself was should go before the other vessels, and that the others
    should follow it; therefore he carried by night on the poop of his
    ship a torch or faggot of burning wood, which they called farol, which
    burned all the night, so that his ships should not lose sight of him.
    Sometimes he set a lantern, sometimes a thick cord of reeds&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> was
    lighted, which was called trenche.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> This is made of reeds well
    soaked in the water, and much beaten, then they are dried in the sun or
    in the smoke, and it is a thing very suitable for such a matter. When
    the captain had made one of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>his signals to his people, they answered
    in the same way. In that manner they knew whether the ships were
    following and keeping together or not. And when he wished to take a
    tack on account of the change of weather, or if the wind was contrary,
    or if he wished to make less way, he had two lights shown; and if he
    wished the others to lower their small sail,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> which was a part of
    the sail attached to the great sail, he showed three lights. Also by
    the three lights, notwithstanding that the wind was fair for going
    faster, he signalled that the studding sail should be lowered; so that
    the great sail might be quicker and more easily struck and furled when
    bad weather should suddenly set in, on account of some squall&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> or
    otherwise. Likewise when the captain wished the other ships to lower
    the sail he had four lights shown, which shortly after he had put out
    and then showed a single one, which was a signal that he wished to stop
    there and turn, so that the other ships might do as he did. Withal,
    when he discovered any land, or shoal, that is to say, a rock at sea,
    he made several lights be shown or had a bombard fired off. If he
    wished to make sail, he signalled to the other ships with four lights,
    so that they should do as he did, and follow him. He always carried
    this said lantern suspended to the poop of his vessel. Also when he
    wished the studding sail to be replaced with the great sail, he showed
    three lights. And to know whether all the ships followed him and were
    coming together, he showed one light only besides the fanol, and then
    each of the ships showed another light, which was an answering signal.</p>

  <p>Besides the above-mentioned ordinances for carrying on seamanship as
    is fitting, and to avoid the dangers which may come upon those who do
    not keep watch, the said captain, who was expert in the things required
    for navigation, ordered that three watches should be kept at night.
    The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>first was at the beginning of the night, the second at midnight,
    and the third towards break of day, which is commonly called <i>La
    diane</i>, otherwise the star of the break of day. Every night these
    watches were changed; that is to say, he who had kept the first watch,
    on the following day kept the second, and he who had kept the second
    kept the third; and so on they changed continually every night. The
    said captain commanded that his regulations both for the signals and
    the watches should be well observed, so that their voyage should be
    made with greater security. The crews of this fleet were divided into
    three companies; the first belonged to the captain, the second to the
    pilot or <i>nochier</i>, and the third to the master. These regulations
    having been made, the captain-general deliberated on sailing, as
    follows.</p>

  <p>Monday, the day of St. Laurence, the 10th of August, in the year above
    mentioned, the fleet, provided with what was necessary for it, and
    carrying crews of different nations, to the number of two hundred and
    thirty-seven men in all the five ships, was ready to set sail from
    the mole of Seville; and firing all the artillery, we made sail only
    on the foremast, and came to the end of a river named Betis, which
    is now called Guadalcavir. In going along this river we passed by a
    place named Gioan de Farax, where there was&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> a large population of
    Moors, and there there was a bridge over the river by which one went to
    Seville. This bridge was ruined, however there had remained two columns
    which are at the bottom of the water, on which account it is necessary
    to have people of the country of experience and knowledge to point out
    the convenient spot for safely passing between these two columns, from
    fear of striking against them. Besides that, it is necessary in order
    to pass safely by this bridge and by other places on this river, that
    the water should be rather high. After having passed the two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>columns
    we came to another place named Coria, and passing by many little
    villages lying along the said river, at last we arrived at a castle,
    which belongs to the Duke of Medina Sidonia, named St. Lucar, where
    there is a port from which to enter the ocean sea. It is entered by
    the east wind and you go out by the west wind. Near there is the cape
    of St. Vincent, which, according to cosmography, is in thirty-seven
    degrees of latitude, at twenty miles distance from the said port; and
    from the aforesaid town to this port by the river there are thirty-five
    or forty miles. A few days afterwards the captain-general came along
    the said river with his boat, and the masters of the other ships with
    him, and we remained some days in this port to supply the fleet with
    some necessary things. We went every day to hear mass on shore, at
    a church named Our Lady of Barrameda, towards St. Lucar. There the
    captain commanded that all the men of the fleet should confess before
    going on any further, in which he himself showed the way to the others.
    Besides he did not choose that anyone should bring any married woman,
    or others to the ships, for several good considerations.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, the 20th September of the said year,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> we set sail from
    St. Lucar, making the course of the south-west otherwise named
    Labeiche;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and on the twenty-sixth of the said month we arrived at
    an island of great Canaria, named Teneriphe, which is in twenty-eight
    degrees latitude; there we remained three days and a half to take in
    provisions and other things which were wanted. After that we set sail
    thence and came to a port named Monterose, where we sojourned two days
    to supply ourselves with pitch, which is a thing necessary for ships.
    It is to be known that among the other isles which are at the said
    great Canaria, there is one, where not a drop of water is to be found
    proceeding from a fountain or a river, only once a day at the hour of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>midday, there descends a cloud from the sky which envelops a large
    tree which is in this island, and it falls upon the leaves of the tree,
    and a great abundance of water distils from these leaves, so that at
    the foot of the tree there is so large a quantity of water that it
    seems as if there was an ever-running fountain. The men who inhabit
    this place are satisfied with this water; also the animals, both
    domestic and wild, drink of it.</p>

  <p>Monday, the third of October of the said year, at the hour of midnight,
    we set sail, making the course auster, which the levantine mariners
    call Siroc,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> entering into the ocean sea. We passed the Cape Verd
    and the neighbouring islands in fourteen-and-a-half degrees, and we
    navigated for several days by the coast of Guinea or Ethiopia; where
    there is a mountain called Sierra Leona, which is in eight degrees
    latitude according to the art and science of cosmography and astrology.
    Sometimes we had the wind contrary and at other times sufficiently
    good, and rains without wind. In this manner we navigated with rain
    for the space of sixty days until the equinoctial line, which was
    a thing very strange and unaccustomed to be seen, according to the
    saying of some old men and those who had navigated here several
    times. Nevertheless, before reaching this equinoctial line we had
    in fourteen degrees a variety of weather and bad winds, as much on
    account of squalls as for the head winds and currents which came in
    such a manner that we could no longer advance. In order that our ships
    might not perish nor broach to&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> (as it often happens when the
    squalls come together), we struck our sails, and in that manner we went
    about the sea hither and thither until the fair weather came. During
    the calm there came large fishes near the ships which they called
    <i>Tiburoni</i> (sharks), which have teeth of a terrible kind, and
    eat people when they find them in the sea either alive or dead. These
    fishes are caught with a device which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>the mariners call hamc, which
    is a hook of iron. Of these, some were caught by our men. However,
    they are worth nothing to eat when they are large; and even the small
    ones are worth but little. During these storms the body of St. Anselme
    appeared to us several times; amongst others, one night that it was
    very dark on account of the bad weather, the said saint appeared in the
    form of a fire lighted at the summit of the mainmast,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and remained
    there near two hours and a half, which comforted us greatly, for we
    were in tears, only expecting the hour of perishing; and when that
    holy light was going away from us it gave out so great a brilliancy in
    the eyes of each, that we were near a quarter-of-an-hour like people
    blinded, and calling out for mercy. For without any doubt nobody hoped
    to escape from that storm. It is to be noted that all and as many times
    as that light which represents the said St. Anselme shows itself and
    descends upon a vessel which is in a storm at sea, that vessel never
    is lost. Immediately that this light had departed the sea grew calmer,
    and then we saw divers sorts of birds, amongst others there were some
    which had no fundament.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> There is also another kind of bird of
    such a nature that when the female wishes to lay her eggs she goes
    and lays them on the back of the male, and there it is that the eggs
    are hatched. This last kind have no feet and are always in the sea.
    There is another kind of bird which only lives on the droppings of the
    other birds, this is a true thing, and they are named Cagaselo, for I
    have seen them follow the other birds until they had done what nature
    ordered them to do; and after it has eat this dirty diet it does not
    follow any other bird until hunger returns to it; it always does the
    same thing.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> There are also fish which fly, and we saw a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>great
    quantity of them together, so many that it seemed that it was an island
    in the sea.</p>

  <p>After that we had passed the equinoctial line, towards the south, we
    lost the star of the tramontana, and we navigated between the south
    and Garbin, which is the collateral wind [or point] between south and
    west; and we crossed as far as a country named Verzin, which is in
    twenty-four degrees and a half of the antarctic sky. This country is
    from the cape St. Augustine, which is in eight degrees in the antarctic
    sky. At this place we had refreshments of victuals, like fowls and
    meat of calves,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> also a variety of fruits, called battate, pigne
    (pine-apples), sweet, of singular goodness, and many other things,
    which I have omitted mentioning, not to be too long. The people of the
    said place gave, in order to have a knife, or a hook&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> for catching
    fish, five or six fowls, and for a comb they gave two geese, and for a
    small mirror, or a pair of scissors, they gave so much fish that ten
    men could have eaten of it. And for a bell (or hawk’s-bell)&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> they
    gave a full basket&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> of the fruit named battate; this has the taste
    of a chestnut, and is of the length of a shuttle.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> For a king of
    cards, of that kind which they used to play with in Italy, they gave me
    five fowls, and thought they had cheated me. We entered into this port
    the day of Saint Lucy&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> [13th December], before Christmas, on which
    day we had the sun on the zenith,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> which is a term of astrology.
    This zenith is a point in the sky, according to astrologers, and only
    in imagination, and it answers to over our head in a straight line, as
    may be seen by the treatise of the sphere,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and by Aristotle, in
    the first book, <cite>De Cælo et Mondo</cite>. On the day that we had the sun
    in the zenith <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>we felt greater heat, as much as when we were on the
    equinoctial line.</p>

  <p>The said country of Verzin is very abundant in all good things, and
    is larger than France, Spain, and Italy together. It is one of the
    countries which the King of Portugal has conquered [acquired]. Its
    inhabitants are not Christians, and adore nothing, but live according
    to the usage of nature, rather bestially than otherwise. Some of these
    people live a hundred, or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and forty
    years, and more; they go naked, both men and women. Their dwellings
    are houses that are rather long, and which they call “boy”; they sleep
    upon cotton nets, which they call, in their language, “amache.” These
    nets are fastened to large timbers from one end of their house to the
    other. They make the fire to warm themselves right under their bed. It
    is to be known that in each of these houses, which they call “boy,”
    there dwells a family of a hundred persons, who make a great noise. In
    this place they have boats, which are made of a tree, all in one piece,
    which they call “canoo.” These are not made with iron instruments, for
    they have not got any, but with stones, like pebbles, and with these
    they plane&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and dig out these boats. Into these thirty or forty
    men enter, and their oars are made like iron shovels: and those who
    row these oars are black people, quite naked and shaven, and look like
    enemies of hell. The men and women of this said place are well made in
    their bodies. They eat the flesh of their enemies, not as good meat,
    but because they have adopted this custom. Now this custom arose as
    follows: an old woman of this place of Verzin had an only son, who was
    killed by his enemies, and, some days afterwards, the friends of this
    woman captured one of the said enemies who had put her son to death,
    and brought him to where she was. Immediately the said old woman,
    seeing the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>man who was captured, and recollecting the death of her
    child, rushed upon him like a mad dog, and bit him on the shoulder.
    However, this man who had been taken prisoner found means to run away,
    and told how they had wished to eat him, showing the bite which the
    said old woman had made in his shoulder. After that those who were
    caught on one side or other were eaten. Through that arose this custom
    in this place of eating the enemies of each other. But they do not eat
    up the whole body of the man whom they take prisoner; they eat him bit
    by bit, and for fear that he should be spoiled, they cut him up into
    pieces, which they set to dry in the chimney, and every day they cut a
    small piece, and eat it with their ordinary victuals in memory of their
    enemies. I was assured that this custom was true by a pilot, named John
    Carvagio, who was in our company, and had remained four years in this
    place; it is also to be observed that the inhabitants of this place,
    both men and women, are accustomed to paint themselves with fire, all
    over the body, and also the face. The men are shaven, and wear no
    beard, because they pluck it out themselves, and for all clothing they
    wear a circle surrounded with the largest feathers of parrots,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and
    they only cover their posterior parts, which is a cause of laughter and
    mockery. The people of this place, almost all, excepting&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> women
    and children, have three holes in the lower lip, and carry, hanging
    in them, small round stones, about a finger in length. These kind of
    people, both men and women, are not very black, but rather brown,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
    and they openly show their shame, and have no hair on the whole of
    their bodies. The king of this country is called <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>Cacich, and there
    are here an infinite number of parrots, of which they give eight or
    ten for a looking-glass; there are also some little cat-monkeys&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
    having almost the appearance of a lion; they are yellow, and handsome,
    and agreeable to look at. The people of this place make bread, which is
    of a round shape, and they take the marrow of certain trees which are
    there, between the bark and the tree, but it is not at all good, and
    resembles fresh cheese. There are also some pigs which have their navel
    on the back,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and large birds which have their beak like a spoon,
    and they have no tongue. For a hatchet or for a knife they used to give
    us one or two of their daughters as slaves, but their wives they would
    not give up for anything in the world. According to what they say the
    women of this place never render duty to their husbands by day, but
    only at night; they attend to business out of doors, and carry all that
    they require for their husband’s victuals inside small baskets on their
    heads, or fastened to their heads. Their husbands go with them, and
    carry a bow of vergin,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> or of black palm, with a handful of arrows
    of cane. They do this because they are very jealous of their wives.
    These carry their children fastened to their neck, and they are inside
    a thing made of cotton in the manner of a net. I omit relating many
    other strange things, not to be too prolix; however, I will not forget
    to say that mass was said twice on shore, where there were many people
    of the said country, who remained on their knees, and their hands
    joined in great reverence, during the mass, so that it was a pleasure
    and a subject of compassion to see them. In a short time they built a
    house for us, as they imagined that we should remain a long time with
    them, and, at our departure thence, they gave us a large quantity of
    verzin. It is a colour which proceeds from the trees which are in this
    country, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>and they are in such quantity that the country is called from
    it Verzin.</p>

  <p>It is to be known that it happened that it had not rained for two
    months before we came there, and the day that we arrived it began
    to rain, on which account the people of the said place said that we
    came from heaven, and had brought the rain with us, which was great
    simplicity, and these people were easily converted to the Christian
    faith. Besides the above-mentioned things which were rather simple,
    the people of this country showed us another, very simple; for they
    imagined that the small ships’ boats were the children of the ships,
    and that the said ships brought them forth when the boats were hoisted
    out to send the men hither and thither; and when the boats were
    alongside the ship they thought that the ships were giving them suck.</p>

  <p>A beautiful young girl came one day inside the ship of our captain,
    where I was, and did not come except to seek for her luck: however,
    she directed her looks to the cabin of the master, and saw a nail of a
    finger’s length, *and went and took it as something valuable and new,
    and hid it in her hair, for otherwise she would not have been able to
    conceal&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> it, because she was naked,* and, bending forwards, she
    went away; and the captain and I saw this mystery.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

  <p>We remained thirteen days in this country of Verzin, and, departing
    from it and following our course, we went as far as thirty-four degrees
    and a third towards the antarctic pole; there we found, near a river,
    men whom they call “cannibals,”&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who eat human flesh, and one of
    these men, great as a giant, came to the captain’s ship to ascertain
    and ask if the others might come. This man had a voice like a bull, and
    whilst this man was at the ship his companions carried off all their
    goods which they had to a castle further off, from fear of us. Seeing
    that, we landed a hundred men from the ships, and went after them to
    try and catch some others; however they gained in running away. This
    kind of people did more with one step than we could do at a bound. In
    this same river there were seven little islands, and in the largest
    of them precious stones are found. This place was formerly called the
    Cape of St. Mary, and it was thought there that from thence there was
    a passage to the Sea of Sur; that is to say, the South Sea. And it
    is not found that any ship has ever discovered anything more, having
    passed beyond the said <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>cape. And now it is no longer a cape, but it
    is a river which has a mouth seventeen leagues in width, by which it
    enters into the sea. In past time, in this river, these great men named
    Canibali ate a Spanish captain, named John de Sola,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and sixty men
    who had gone to discover land, as we were doing, and trusted too much
    to them.</p>

  <p>Afterwards following the same course towards the Antarctic pole, going
    along the land, we found two islands full of geese and goslings, and
    sea wolves, of which geese the large number could not be reckoned;
    for we loaded all the five ships with them in an hour. These geese
    are black, and have their feathers all over the body of the same size
    and shape, and they do not fly, and live upon fish; and they were so
    fat that they did not pluck them, but skinned them. They have beaks
    like that of a crow. The sea wolves of these two islands are of many
    colours, and of the size and thickness of a calf, and have a head like
    that of a calf, and the ears small and round. They have large teeth,
    and have no legs, but feet joining close on to the body, which resemble
    a human hand; they have small nails to their feet, and skin between the
    fingers like geese. If these animals could run they would be very bad
    and cruel, but they do not stir from the water, and swim and live upon
    fish. In this place we endured a great storm, and thought we should
    have been lost, but the three holy bodies, that is to say, St. Anselmo,
    St. Nicolas, and Sta. Clara, appeared to us, and immediately the storm
    ceased.</p>

  <p>Departing thence as far as forty nine degrees and a half in the
    Antarctic heavens (as we were in the winter), we entered into a port
    to pass the winter, and remained there two whole months without ever
    seeing anybody. However, one day, without anyone expecting it, we
    saw a giant, who was on the shore of the sea, quite naked, and was
    dancing and leaping, and singing, and whilst singing he put the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>sand
    and dust on his head. Our captain sent one of his men towards him,
    whom he charged to sing and leap like the other to reassure him, and
    show him friendship. This he did, and immediately the sailor led this
    giant to a little island where the captain was waiting for him; and
    when he was before us he began to be astonished, and to be afraid, and
    he raised one finger on high,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> thinking that we came from heaven.
    He was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his waist;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
    however&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> he was well built. He had a large face, painted red all
    round, and his eyes also were painted yellow around them, and he had
    two hearts painted on his cheeks; he had but little hair on his head,
    and it was painted white. When he was brought before the captain he
    was clothed with the skin of a certain beast, which skin was very
    skilfully sewed. This beast&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has its head and ears of the size of
    a mule, and the neck and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a
    deer, and the tail like that of a horse, and it neighs like a horse.
    There is a great quantity of these animals in this same place. This
    giant had his feet covered with the skin of this animal in the form of
    shoes, and he carried in his hand a short and thick bow, with a thick
    cord made of the gut of the said beast, with a bundle of cane arrows,
    which were not very long, and were feathered like ours,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> but they
    had no iron at the end, though they had at the end some small white and
    black cut stones, and these arrows were like those which the Turks use.
    The captain caused food and drink to be given to this giant, then they
    showed him some things, amongst others, a steel mirror. When the giant
    saw his likeness in it, he was greatly terrified, leaping backwards,
    and made three or four of our men fall down.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>After that the captain gave him two bells, a mirror, a comb, and a
    chaplet of beads, and sent him back on shore, having him accompanied by
    four armed men. One of the companions of this giant, who would never
    come to the ship, on seeing the other coming back with our people, came
    forward and ran to where the other giants dwelled. These came one after
    the other all naked, and began to leap and sing, raising one finger to
    heaven, and showing to our people a certain white powder made of the
    roots of herbs, which they kept in earthen pots, and they made signs
    that they lived on that, and that they had nothing else to eat than
    this powder. Therefore our people made them signs to come to the ship
    and that they would help them to carry their bundles.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Then these
    men came, who carried only their bows in their hands; but their wives
    came after them laden like donkeys, and carried their goods. These
    women are not as tall as the men, but they are very sufficiently large.
    When we saw them we were all amazed and astonished, for they had the
    breasts half an ell&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> long, and had their faces painted, and were
    dressed like the men. But they wore a small skin before them to cover
    themselves. They brought with them four of those little beasts of which
    they make their clothing, and they led them with a cord in the manner
    of dogs coupled together. When these people wish to catch these animals
    with which they clothe themselves, they fasten one of the young ones
    to a bush, and afterwards the large ones come to play with the little
    one, and the giants are hid behind some hedge, and by shooting their
    arrows they kill the large ones. Our men brought eighteen of these
    giants, both men and women, whom they placed in two divisions, half on
    one side of the port, and the other half at the other, to hunt the said
    animals. Six days after, our people on going to cut wood, saw another
    giant, with his face painted and clothed like the above-mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> he
    had in his hand a bow and arrows, and approaching our people he made
    some touches on his head and then on his body, and afterwards did the
    same to our people. And this being done he raised both his hands to
    heaven. When the captain-general knew all this, he sent to fetch him
    with his ship’s boat, and brought him to one of the little islands
    which are in the port, where the ships were. In this island the captain
    had caused a house to be made for putting some of the ships’ things in
    whilst he remained there. This giant was of a still better disposition
    than the others, and was a gracious and amiable person, who liked to
    dance and leap. When he leapt he caused the earth to sink in a palm
    depth at the place where his feet touched. He was a long time with us,
    and at the end we baptised him, and gave him the name of John. This
    giant pronounced the name of Jesus, the Pater noster, Ave Maria, and
    his name as clearly as we did: but he had a terribly strong and loud
    voice. The captain gave him a shirt and a tunic&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> of cloth, and
    seaman’s breeches,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> a cap, a comb, some bells, and other things,
    and sent him back to where he had come from. He went away very joyous
    and satisfied. The next day this giant returned, and brought one of
    those large animals before mentioned, for which the captain gave him
    some other things, so that he should bring more. But afterwards he did
    not return, and it is to be presumed that the other giants killed him
    because he had come to us.</p>

  <p>Fifteen days later we saw four other giants, who carried no arrows,
    for they had hid them in the bushes, as two of them showed us, for we
    took them all four, and each of them was painted in a different way.
    The captain retained the two younger ones to take them to Spain on his
    return; but it was done by gentle and cunning means, for otherwise
    they would have done a hurt to some of our men. The manner in which
    he retained them was that he gave them <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>many knives, forks, mirrors,
    bells, and glass, and they held all these things in their hands. Then
    the captain had some irons brought, such as are put on the feet of
    malefactors: these giants took pleasure in seeing the irons, but they
    did not know where to put them, and it grieved them that they could not
    take them with their hands, because they were hindered by the other
    things which they held in them. The other two giants were there, and
    were desirous of helping the other two, but the captain would not let
    them, and made a sign to the two whom he wished to detain that they
    would put those irons on their feet, and then they would go away:
    at this they made a sign with their heads that they were content.
    Immediately the captain had the irons put on the feet of both of them,
    and when they saw that they were striking with a hammer on the bolt
    which crosses the said irons to rivet them, and prevent them from
    being opened, these giants were afraid, but the captain made them a
    sign not to doubt of anything. Nevertheless when they saw the trick
    which had been played them, they began to be enraged,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and to
    foam like bulls, crying out very loud Setebos,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> that is to say,
    the great devil, that he should help them. The hands of the other two
    giants were bound, but it was with great difficulty; then the captain
    sent them back on shore, with nine of his men to conduct them, and to
    bring the wife of one of those who had remained in irons, because he
    regretted her greatly, as we saw by signs. But in going away one of
    those two who were sent away, untied his hands and escaped, running
    with such lightness that our men lost sight of him, and he went away
    where his companions were staying; but he found nobody of those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>that
    he had left with the women because they had gone to hunt. However he
    went to look for them, and found them, and related to them all that
    had been done to them. The other giant whose hands were tied struggled
    as much as he could to unfasten himself, and to prevent his doing so,
    one of our men struck him, and hurt him on the head, at which he got
    very angry; however he led our people there where their wives were.
    Then John Cavagio,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> the pilot who was the chief conductor of these
    two giants, would not bring away the wife of one of the giants who had
    remained in irons on that evening, but was of opinion that they should
    sleep there, because it was almost night. During this time the one of
    the giants who had untied his hands came back from where he had been,
    with another giant, and they seeing their companion wounded on the
    head, said nothing at that moment, but next morning they spoke in their
    language to the women, and immediately all ran away together, and the
    smallest ran faster than the biggest, and they left all their chattels.
    Two of these giants being rather a long way off shot arrows at our men,
    and fighting thus, one of the giants pierced with an arrow the thigh
    of one of our men, of which he died immediately. Then seeing that he
    was dead, all ran away. Our men had cross-bows and guns,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> but they
    never could hit one of these giants, because they did not stand still
    in one place, but leaped hither and thither. After that, our men buried
    the man who had been killed, and set fire to the place where those
    giants had left their chattels. Certainly these giants run faster than
    a horse, and they are very jealous of their wives.</p>

  <p>When these giants have a stomach-ache, instead of taking medicine they
    put down their throats an arrow about two feet long; then they vomit a
    green bile&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> mixed with blood: and the reason why they throw up this
    green matter is because they sometimes eat thistles. When they have
    headaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> they make a cut across the forehead, and also on the arms
    and legs, to draw blood from several parts of their bodies. One of the
    two we had taken, and who was in our ship, said that the blood did not
    choose to remain in the place and spot of the body where pain was felt.
    These people have their hair cut short and clipped in the manner of
    monks with a tonsure: they wear a cord of cotton round their head, to
    this they hang their arrows when they go a-hunting....&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

  <p>When one of them dies, ten or twelve devils appear and dance all round
    the dead man. It seems that these are painted, and one of these enemies
    is taller than the others, and makes a greater noise, and more mirth
    than the others: that is whence these people have taken the custom
    of painting their faces and bodies, as has been said. The greatest
    of these devils is called in their language Setebos, and the others
    Cheleule. Besides the above-mentioned things, this one who was in
    the ship with us, told us by signs that he had seen devils with two
    horns on their heads, and long hair down to their feet, and who threw
    out fire from their mouths and rumps. The captain named this kind of
    people Pataghom,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> who have no houses, but have huts made of the
    skins of the animals with which they clothe themselves, and go hither
    and thither with these huts of theirs, as the gypsies&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> do; they
    live on raw meat, and eat a certain sweet root, which they call Capac.
    These two giants that we had in the ship ate a large basketful&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> of
    biscuit, and rats without skinning them, and they drank half a bucket
    of water at each time.</p>

  <p>We remained in this port, which was called the port of St. Julian,
    about five months, during which there happened to us many strange
    things, of which I will tell a part. One was, that immediately that we
    entered into this port, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>masters of the other four ships plotted
    treason against the captain-general, in order to put him to death.
    These were thus named: John of Carthagine, conductor&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> of the fleet;
    the treasurer, Loys de Mendoza; the conductor,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Anthony Cocha; and
    Gaspar de Casada.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> However, the treason was discovered, for which
    the treasurer was killed with stabs of a dagger, and then quartered.
    This Gaspar de Casada had his head cut off, and afterwards was cut into
    quarters; and the conductor having a few days later attempted another
    treason, was banished with a priest, and was put in that country called
    Pattagonia.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The captain-general would not put this conductor to
    death, because the Emperor Charles had made him captain of one of the
    ships. One of our ships, named St. James, was lost in going to discover
    the coast; all the men, however, were saved by a miracle, for they
    were hardly wet at all. Two men of these, who were saved, came to us
    and told us all that had passed and happened, on which the captain at
    once sent some men with sacks full of biscuit for two months. So, each
    day we found something of the ship of the other men who had escaped
    from the ship which was lost; and the place where these men were was
    twenty-five leagues from us, and the road bad and full of thorns,
    and it required four days to go there, and no water to drink was to
    be found on the road, but only ice, and of that little. In this port
    of St Julian there were a great quantity of long capres,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> called
    Missiglione; these had pearls in the midst. In this place they found
    incense, and ostriches, foxes, sparrows, and rabbits&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>a good deal
    smaller than ours.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We set up at the top of the highest mountain
    which was there a very large cross, as a sign that this country
    belonged to the King of Spain; and we gave to this mountain the name of
    Mount of Christ.</p>

  <p>Departing thence, we found in fifty-one degrees less one-third (50°
    40′ S.), in the Antarctic, a river of fresh water, which was near
    causing us to be lost, from the great winds which it sent out; but
    God, of his favour, aided us. We were about two months in this river,
    as it supplied fresh water and a kind of fish an ell long, and very
    scaly,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> which is good to eat. Before going away, the captain chose
    that all should confess and receive the body of our Lord like good
    Christians.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>CHAPTER.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></h3>

  <p>After going and taking the course to the fifty-second degree of the
    said Antarctic sky, on the day of the Eleven Thousand Virgins [October
    21], we found, by a miracle, a strait which we called the Cape of the
    Eleven Thousand Virgins, this strait is a hundred and ten leagues long,
    which are four hundred and forty miles, and almost as wide as less than
    half a league,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and it issues in another sea, which is called the
    peaceful sea;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> it is surrounded by very great and high mountains
    covered with snow. In this place it was not possible to anchor&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
    with the anchors, because no bottom was found, on which account
    they were forced to put the moorings&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> of twenty-five or thirty
    fathoms <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>length on shore. This strait was a round place surrounded
    by mountains, as I have said, and the greater number of the sailors
    thought that there was no place by which to go out thence to enter into
    the peaceful sea. But the captain-general said that there was another
    strait for going out, and said that he knew it well, because he had
    seen it by a marine chart of the King of Portugal, which map had been
    made by a great pilot and mariner named Martin of Bohemia.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The
    captain sent on before two of his ships, one named <cite>St. Anthony</cite>
    and the other the <cite>Conception</cite>, to seek for and discover the
    outlet of this strait, which was called the Cape de la Baya. And
    we, with the other two ships, that is to say, the flagship named
    <cite>Trinitate</cite>, and the other the <cite>Victory</cite>, remained waiting
    for them within the Bay, where in the night we had a great storm, which
    lasted till the next day at midday, and during which we were forced to
    weigh the anchors and let the ships go hither and thither about the
    bay. The other two ships met with such a head wind&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> that they could
    not weather&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> a cape which the bay made almost at its extremity;
    wishing to come to us, they were near being driven to beach the
    ships.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> But, on approaching the extremity of the bay, and whilst
    expecting to be lost, they saw a small mouth, which did not resemble
    a mouth but a corner,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and (like people giving up hope&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>)
    they threw themselves into it, so that by force they discovered the
    strait. Seeing that it was not a corner, but a strait of land, they
    went further on and found a bay, then going still further they found
    another strait and another bay larger <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>than the first two, at which,
    being very joyous, they suddenly returned backwards to tell it to the
    captain-general. Amongst us we thought that they had perished: first,
    because of the great storm; next, because two days had passed that we
    had not seen them. And being thus in doubt&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> we saw the two ships
    under all sail, with ensigns spread, come towards us: these, when near
    us, suddenly discharged much artillery, at which we, very joyous,
    saluted them with artillery and shouts. Afterwards, all together,
    thanking God and the Virgin Mary, we went to seek further on.</p>

  <p>After having entered inside this strait we found that there were two
    mouths, of which one trended to the Sirocco (S.E.), and the other to
    the Garbin (S.W.). On that account the captain again sent the two
    ships, <cite>St. Anthony</cite> and <cite>Conception</cite>, to see if the mouth
    which was towards Sirocco had an outlet beyond into the said peaceful
    sea. One of these two ships, named <cite>St. Anthony</cite>, would not wait
    for the other ship, because those who were inside wished to return to
    Spain: this they did, and the principal reason was on account of the
    pilot&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> of the said ship being previously discontented with the said
    captain-general, because that before this armament was made, this pilot
    had gone to the Emperor to talk about having some ships to discover
    countries. But, on account of the arrival of the captain-general, the
    Emperor did not give them to this pilot, on account of which he agreed
    with some Spaniards, and the following night they took prisoner the
    captain of their ship, who was a brother&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> of the captain-general,
    and who was named Alvar de Meschite; they wounded him, and put him in
    irons. So they carried him off to Spain. And in this ship, which went
    away and returned, was one of the two above-mentioned giants whom we
    had taken, and when he felt the heat he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>died. The other ship, named
    the <cite>Conception</cite>, not being able to follow that one, was always
    waiting for it, and fluttered hither and thither. But it lost its time,
    for the other took the road by night for returning. When this happened,
    at night the ship of the captain and the other ship went together to
    discover the other mouth to Garbin (S.W.), where, on always holding on
    our course, we found the same strait. But at the end&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> we arrived at
    a river which we named the River of Sardines, because we found a great
    quantity of them. So we remained there four days to wait for the other
    two ships. A short time after we sent a boat well supplied with men and
    provisions to discover the cape of the other sea: these remained three
    days in going and coming. They told us that they had found the cape,
    and the sea great and wide. At the joy which the captain-general had at
    this he began to cry, and he gave the name of Cape of Desire to this
    cape, as a thing which had been much desired for a long time. Having
    done that we turned back to find the two ships which were at the other
    side, but we only found the <cite>Conception</cite>, of which ship we asked
    what had become of her companion. To this the captain of the said ship,
    named John Serrano (who was pilot of the first ship which was lost, as
    has been related), replied that he knew nothing of her, and that he
    had never seen her since she entered the mouth. However, we sought for
    her through all the strait, as far as the said mouth, by which she had
    taken her course to return. Besides that, the Captain-General sent back
    the ship named the <cite>Victory</cite> as far as the entrance of the strait
    to see if the ship was there, and he told the people of this ship that
    if they did not find the ship they were looking for, they were to
    place an ensign on the summit of a small hill, with a letter inside a
    pot placed in the ground near the ensign, so that if the ship should
    by chance return, it might see that ensign, and also find the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>letter
    which would give information of the course which the captain was
    holding. This manner of acting had been ordained by the captain from
    the commencement, in order to effect the junction of any ship which
    might be separated from the others. So the people of the said ship did
    what the captain had commanded them, and more, for they set two ensigns
    with letters; one of the ensigns was placed on a small hill at the
    first bay, the other on an islet in the third bay, where there were
    many sea wolves and large birds. The captain-general waited for them
    with the other ship near the river named Isles: and he caused a cross
    to be set upon a small island in front of that river, which was between
    high mountains covered with snow. This river comes and falls into the
    sea near the other river of the Sardines.</p>

  <p>If we had not found this strait the captain-general had made up his
    mind to go as far as seventy-five degrees towards the antarctic pole;
    where at that height in the summer time there is no night, or very
    little: in a similar manner in the winter there is no day-light, or
    very little, and so that every one may believe this, when we were in
    this strait the night lasted only three hours, and this was in the
    month of October.</p>

  <p>The land of this strait on the left hand side looked towards the
    Sirocco wind, which is the wind collateral to the Levant and South; we
    called this strait Pathagonico. In it we found at every half league
    a good port and place for anchoring, good waters, wood all of cedar,
    and fish like sardines, missiglioni, and a very sweet herb named appio
    (celery).&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> There is also some of the same kind which is bitter.
    This herb grows near the springs, and from not finding anything else
    we ate of it for several days. I think that there is not in the world
    a more beautiful country, or better strait than this one. In this
    ocean sea one sees a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>very amusing chase of fish, which are of three
    sorts, of an ell or more in length, and they call these fish Dorades,
    Albacores, and Bonitos; these follow and pursue another sort of fish
    which flies, which they call Colondriny,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> which are a foot long or
    more, and are very good to eat. When these three sorts of fish find in
    the water any of these flying fish, immediately they make them come out
    of the water, and they fly more than a cross bow-shot, as long as their
    wings are wet; and whilst these fishes fly the other three run after
    them under the water, seeing the shadow of those that fly: and the
    moment they fall into the water they are seized upon and eaten by the
    others which pursue them, which is a thing marvellous and agreeable to
    see.</p>

    thus name that root which they use for bread, and <i>oli</i> that is
    to say water. When he saw me write these names after him, and ask for

    Another time I made a cross and kissed it in showing it to him; but

    this giant was unwell&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> he asked for the cross, and embraced and
    kissed it much, and he wished to become a Christian before his death,

  <h4>(<i>In the Milan Edition here begins Book II.</i>)</h4>

  <p>Wednesday, the twenty-eighth of November, 1520, we came forth out of
    the said strait, and entered into the Pacific sea, where we remained
    three months and twenty days without taking in provisions or other
    refreshments, and we only ate old biscuit reduced to powder, and full
    of grubs, and stinking from the dirt which the rats had made on it
    when eating the good biscuit, and we drank water that was yellow and
    stinking. We also ate the ox hides which were under the main-yard,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
    so that the yard should not break the rigging:&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> they were very hard
    on account of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>the sun, rain, and wind, and we left them for four
    or five days in the sea, and then we put them a little on the embers,
    and so ate them; also the sawdust of wood,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and rats which cost
    half-a-crown&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> each, moreover enough of them were not to be got.
    Besides the above-named evils, this misfortune which I will mention
    was the worst, it was that the upper and lower gums of most of our
    men grew so much&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> that they could not eat, and in this way so
    many suffered, that nineteen died, and the other giant, and an Indian
    from the county of Verzin. Besides those who died, twenty-five or
    thirty fell ill of divers sicknesses, both in the arms and legs, and
    other places, in such manner that very few remained healthy. However,
    thanks be to the Lord, I had no sickness. During those three months
    and twenty days we went in an open sea,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> while we ran fully four
    thousand leagues in the Pacific sea. This was well named Pacific, for
    during this same time we met with no storm, and saw no land except two
    small uninhabited islands, in which we found only birds and trees. We
    named them the Unfortunate Islands; they are two hundred leagues apart
    from one another, and there is no place to anchor, as there is no
    bottom. There we saw many sharks, which are a kind of large fish which
    they call Tiburoni. The first isle is in fifteen degrees of austral
    latitude,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and the other island is in nine degrees. With the said
    wind we ran each day fifty or sixty leagues,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> or more; now with the
    wind astern, sometimes on a wind&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> or otherwise. And if our Lord
    and his Mother had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>not aided us in giving us good weather to refresh
    ourselves with provisions and other things, we should all have died of
    hunger in this very vast sea, and I think that never man will undertake
    to perform such a voyage.</p>

  <p>When we had gone out of this strait, if we had always navigated to the
    west we should have gone&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> without finding any land except the Cape
    of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, which is the eastern head of the strait
    in the ocean sea, with the Cape of Desire at the west in the Pacific
    sea. These two capes are exactly in fifty-two degrees of latitude of
    the antarctic pole.</p>

  <p>The antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic, for
    there are to be seen there many small stars congregated together,
    which are like to two clouds a little separated from one another, and
    a little dimmed,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> in the midst of which are two stars, not very

    stars are the antarctic pole. Our compass needle still pointed a little

    sail, in what direction they were navigating and pointing the charts.
    They all replied, by the course he had given, punctually [pricked in];
    then he answered, that they were pointing falsely (which was so), and
    that it was fitting to arrange the needle of navigation, because it
    did not receive so much force as in its own quarter. When we were in
    the middle of this open sea we saw a cross of five stars, very bright,
    straight, in the west, and they are straight one with another.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

  <p>During this time of two months and twelve days we navigated between
    west and north-west (maestral), and a quarter west of north-west, and
    also north-west, until we came to the equinoctial line, which was at
    [a point] one hundred and twenty-two degrees distant from the line
    of repartition. This line of delimitation is thirty degrees distant
    from the meridian,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and the meridian&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> is three degrees distant
    from the Cape Verd towards the east.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In going by this course we
    passed near two very rich islands; one is in twenty degrees latitude
    in the antarctic pole, and is called Cipanghu; the other, in fifteen
    degrees of the same pole, is named Sumbdit Pradit. After we had passed
    the equinoctial line we navigated between west, and north-west and a
    quarter west, by north-west. Afterwards we made two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>hundred leagues to
    westwards, then changed the course to a quarter of south-west, until
    in thirteen degrees north latitude, in order to approach the land of
    Cape Gaticara,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> which cape (under correction of those who have made
    cosmography), (for they have never seen it), is not placed where they
    think, but is towards the north, in twelve degrees or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>After having navigated sixty leagues&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> by the said course, in
    twelve degrees latitude, and a hundred and forty-six of longitude,
    on Wednesday, the 6th of March, we discovered a small island in the
    north-west direction,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and two others lying to the south-west.
    One of these islands was larger and higher than the other two. The
    captain-general wished to touch at the largest of these three islands
    to get refreshments of provisions; but it was not possible because the
    people of these islands entered into the ships and robbed us, in such
    a way that it was impossible to preserve oneself from them. Whilst we
    were striking and lowering the sails to go ashore, they stole away
    with much address and diligence the small boat called the skiff, which
    was made fast to the poop of the captain’s ship, at which he was much
    irritated, and went on shore with forty armed men, burned forty or
    fifty houses, with several small boats, and killed seven men of the
    island; they recovered their skiff. After this we set sail suddenly,
    following the same course. Before we went ashore some of our sick men
    begged us that if we killed man or woman, that we should bring them
    their entrails, as they would see themselves suddenly cured.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

  <h3>CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>It must be known that when we wounded any of this kind of people with
    our arrows, which entered inside their bodies, they looked at the
    arrow, and then drew it forth with much astonishment, and immediately
    afterwards they died.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Immediately after we sailed from that
    island, following our course, and those people seeing that we were
    going away followed us for a league, with a hundred small boats, or
    more, and they approached our ships, showing to us fish, and feigning
    to give it to us. But they threw stones at us, and then ran away, and
    in their flight they passed with their little boats between the boat
    which is towed at the poop and the ship going under full sail; but they
    did this so quickly, and with such skill that it was a wonder. And
    we saw some of these women, who cried out and tore their hair, and I
    believe&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> that it was for the love of those whom we had killed.</p>

  <hr>
  <h3>CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>These people live in liberty and according to their will, for they
    have no lord or superior; they go quite naked, and some of them wear
    beards, and have their hair down to the waist. They wear small hats,
    after the fashion of the Albanians; these hats are made of palm leaves.
    The people are as tall as us, and well made: they adore nothing,
    and when they are born they are white, later they become brown, and
    have their teeth black and red. The women also go naked, except that
    they cover their nature with a thin bark, pliable like paper, which
    grows between the tree and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>bark of the palm. They are beautiful
    and delicate, and whiter than the men, and have their hair loose and
    flowing, very black and long, down to the earth. They do not go to work
    in the fields, nor stir from their houses, making cloth and baskets of
    palm leaves. Their provisions are certain fruits named Cochi, Battate;
    there are birds, figs a palm long,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> sweet canes, and flying fish.
    The women anoint their bodies and their hair with oil of cocho and
    giongioli (sesame). Their houses are constructed of wood, covered with
    planks, with fig leaves, which are two ells in length: they have only
    one floor: their rooms and beds are furnished with mats,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> which
    we call matting,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> which are made of palm leaves, and are very
    beautiful, and they lie down on palm straw, which is soft and fine.
    These people have no arms, but use sticks,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> which have a fish bone
    at the end. They are poor, but ingenious, and great thieves, and for
    the sake of that we called these three islands the Ladrone Islands. The
    pastime of the men and the women of this place, and their diversion,
    is to go with their little boats to catch those fish which fly, with
    hooks made of fish bones. The pattern of their small boats is painted
    here-after, they are like the fuseleres,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> but narrower. Some of
    them black and white, and others red. On the opposite side to the sail,
    they have a large piece of wood, pointed above, with poles across,
    which are in the water, in order to go more securely under sail: their
    sails are of palm leaves, sewed together, and of the shape of a lateen
    sail, fore and aft. They have certain shovels like hearth shovels,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
    and there is no difference between the poop and the prow in these
    boats, and they are like dolphins bounding from wave to wave. These
    thieves thought, according to the signs they made, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>that there were no
    other men in the world besides them.</p>

  <p>Saturday, the 16th of March, 1521, we arrived at daybreak in sight of
    a high island, three hundred leagues distant from the before-mentioned
    Thieves’ island. This isle is named Zamal.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The next day the
    captain-general wished to land at another uninhabited island near the
    first,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> to be in greater security and to take water, also to repose
    there a few days. He set up there two tents on shore for the sick, and
    had a sow&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> killed for them.</p>

  <p>Monday, the 18th of March, after dinner, we saw a boat come towards
    us with nine men in it: upon which the captain-general ordered
    that no one should move or speak without his permission.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> When
    these people had come into this island towards us, immediately the
    principal&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> one amongst them went towards the captain-general with
    demonstrations of being very joyous at our arrival. Five of the most
    showy&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of them remained with us, the others who remained with the
    boat went to call some men who were fishing, and afterwards all of
    them came together.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The captain seeing that these people were
    reasonable,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> ordered food and drink to be given them, and he gave
    them some red caps, looking glasses, combs, bells, ivory, and other
    things. When these people saw the politeness of the captain, they
    presented some fish, and a vessel of palm wine, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>they call in
    their language Uraca;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> figs more than a foot&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> long, and others
    smaller and of a better savour, and two cochos.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> At that time they
    had nothing to give him, and they made signs to us with their hands
    that in four days they would bring us Umai, which is rice, cocos, and
    many other victuals.</p>

  <p>To explain the kind of fruits above-named it must be known that the one
    which they call cochi, is the fruit which the palm trees bear. And as
    we have bread, wine, oil, and vinegar, proceeding from different kinds,
    so these people have those things proceeding from these palm trees
    only. It must be said that wine proceeds from the said palm trees in
    the following manner. They make a hole at the summit of the tree as far
    as its heart, which is named palmito, from which a liquor comes out in
    drops down the tree, like white must, which is sweet, but with somewhat
    of bitter.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> They have canes as thick as the leg, in which they draw
    off this liquor, and they fasten them to the tree from the evening till
    next morning, and from the morning to the evening, because this liquor
    comes little by little. This palm produces a fruit named cocho, which
    is as large as the head, or thereabouts: its first husk is green, and
    two fingers in thickness, in it they find certain threads, with which
    they make the cords for fastening their boats. Under this husk there is
    another very hard, and thicker than that of a walnut. They burn this
    second rind, and make with it a powder which is useful to them. Under
    this rind there is a white marrow of a finger’s thickness, which they
    eat fresh with meat and fish, as we do bread, and it has the taste
    of an almond, and if anyone dried it&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> he might make bread of it.
    From the middle of this marrow there comes out a clear sweet water,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>and very cordial, which, when it has rested a little, and settled,
    congeals and becomes like an apple.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> When they wish to make oil
    they take this fruit, the coco, and let it get rotten, and they corrupt
    this marrow in the water, then they boil it, and it becomes oil in
    the manner&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> of butter. When they want to make vinegar, they let
    the water in the cocoa-nut get bad, and they put it in the sun, when
    it turns to vinegar like white wine. From this fruit milk also can be
    made, as we experienced, for we scraped this marrow and then put it
    with its water, and passed it through a cloth, and thus it was milk
    like that of goats. This kind of palm tree is like the date-palm,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
    but not so rugged. Two of these trees can maintain a family of ten
    persons: but they do not draw wine as above-mentioned always from one
    tree, but draw from one for eight days, and from the other as long. For
    if they did not, otherwise the trees would dry up. In this manner they
    last a hundred years.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

  <p>These people became very familiar and friendly with us, and explained
    many things to us in their language, and told us the names of some
    islands which we saw with our eyes before us. *The island where they
    dwelt is called Zuluam, and it is not large.*&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> As they were
    sufficiently agreeable and conversible we had great pleasure with
    them. The captain seeing that they were of this good condition, to do
    them greater honour conducted them to the ship, and showed them all
    his goods, that is to say, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg,
    mace,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> gold, and all that was in the ship. He also had some shots
    fired with his artillery, at which they were so much afraid that they
    wished to jump <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>from the ship into the sea. They made signs that the
    things which the captain had shown them grew there where we were going.
    When they wished to leave us they took leave of the captain and of us
    with very good manners and gracefulness, promising us to come back to
    see us. The island we were at was named Humunu; nevertheless because we
    found there two springs of very fresh water we named it the Watering
    Place of good signs,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and because we found here the first signs of
    gold. There is much white coral to be found here, and large trees which
    bear fruit smaller than an almond, and which are like pines. There were
    also many palm trees both good and bad. In this place there were many
    circumjacent islands, on which account we named them the archipelago
    of St. Lazarus, because we stayed there on the day and feast of St.
    Lazarus. This region and archipelago is in ten degrees north latitude,
    and a hundred and sixty-one degrees longitude from the line of
    demarcation.</p>

  <p>Friday, the 22nd of March, the above-mentioned people, who had promised
    us to return, came about midday, with two boats laden with the said
    fruit cochi, sweet oranges, a vessel of palm wine, and a cock, to give
    us to understand that they had poultry in their country, so that we
    bought all that they brought. The lord of these people was old, and had
    his face painted, and had gold rings suspended to his ears, which they
    name Schione,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and the others had many bracelets and rings of gold
    on their arms, with a wrapper of linen round their head. We remained
    at this place eight days: the captain went there every day to see his
    sick men, whom he had placed on this island to refresh them: and he
    gave them himself every day the water of this said fruit the cocho,
    which comforted them much. Near this isle is another where there are a
    kind of people who wear <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>holes&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> in their ears so large that they
    can pass their arms through them; these people are Caphre, that is to
    say, Gentiles, and they go naked, except that round their middles they
    wear cloth made of the bark of trees. But there are some of the more
    remarkable of them who wear cotton stuff, and at the end of it there
    is some work of silk done with a needle. These people are tawny,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
    fat, and painted, and they anoint themselves with the oil of coco nuts
    and sesame,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> to preserve them from the sun and the wind. Their hair
    is very black and long, reaching to the waist, and they carry small
    daggers and knives, ornamented with gold, and many other things, such
    as darts,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> harpoons, and nets to fish, like...,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and their
    boats are like ours.</p>

  <p>The Monday of Passion week, the 25th of March, and feast of our Lady,
    in the afternoon, and being ready to depart from this place, I went to
    the side of our ship to fish, and putting my feet on a spar to go down
    to the store room,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> my feet slipped, because it had rained, and I
    fell into the sea without any one seeing me, and being near drowning
    by luck I found at my left hand the sheet of the large sail which was
    in the sea, I caught hold of it and began to cry out till they came to
    help and pick me up with the boat. I was assisted not by my merits,
    but by the mercy and grace of the fountain of pity. That same day we
    took the course between west and southwest,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and passed amidst four
    small islands, that is to say, Cenalo, Huinanghar, Ibusson, and Abarien.</p>

  <p>Thursday, the 28th of March, having seen the night before fire upon
    an island, at the morning we came to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>anchor at this island; where
    we saw a small boat which they call Boloto, with eight men inside,
    which approached the ship of the captain-general. Then a slave of the
    captain’s, who was from Sumatra, otherwise named Traprobana, spoke
    from afar to these people, who understood his talk,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and came near
    to the side of the ship, but they withdrew immediately, and would not
    enter the ship from fear of us. So the captain seeing that they would
    not trust to us showed them a red cap, and other things, which he had
    tied and placed on a little plank,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and the people in the boat took
    them immediately and joyously, and then returned to advise their king.
    Two hours afterwards, or thereabouts, we saw come two long boats, which
    they call Ballanghai, full of men. In the largest of them was their
    king sitting under an awning of mats; when they were near the ship of
    the captain-general, the said slave spoke to the king, who understood
    him well, because in these countries the kings know more languages than
    the common people. Then the king ordered some of his people to go to
    the captain’s ship, whilst he would not move from his boat, which was
    near enough to us. This was done, and when his people returned to the
    boat, he went away at once. The captain gave good entertainment to the
    men who came to his ship, and gave them all sorts of things, on which
    account the king wished to give the captain a rather large bar of solid
    gold, and a chest&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> full of ginger. However, the captain thanked him
    very much but would not accept the present. After that, when it was
    late, we went with the ships near to the houses and abode of the king.</p>

  <p>The next day which was Good Friday, the captain sent on shore the
    before-mentioned slave, who was our interpreter, to the king to beg
    him to give him for money some provisions for his ships, sending him
    word that he had not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>come to his country as an enemy, but as a friend.
    The king on hearing this came with seven or eight men in a boat, and
    entered the ship, and embraced the captain, and gave him three china
    dishes covered with leaves full of rice, and two <i>dorades</i>, which
    are rather large fish, and of the sort above-mentioned, and he gave
    him several other things. The captain gave this king a robe of red and
    yellow cloth, made in the Turkish fashion, and a very fine red cap, and
    to his people he gave to some of them knives, and to others mirrors.
    After that refreshments were served up to them. The captain told the
    king, through the said interpreter, that he wished to be with him,
    <i>cassi&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> cassi</i>, that is to say, brothers. To which the king
    answered that he desired to be the same towards him. After that the
    captain showed him cloths of different colours, linen, coral, and much
    other merchandise, and all the artillery, of which he had some pieces
    fired before him, at which the king was much astonished; after that the
    captain had one of his soldiers armed with white armour, and placed him
    in the midst of three comrades, who struck him with swords and daggers.
    The king thought this very strange, and the captain told him, through
    the interpreter, that a man thus in white armour was worth a hundred
    of his men; he answered that it was true; he was further informed that
    there were in each ship two hundred like that man. After that the
    captain showed him a great number of swords, cuirasses, and helmets,
    and made two of the men play with their swords before the king; he then
    showed him the sea chart and the ship compass, and informed him how he
    had found the strait to come there, and of the time which he had spent
    in coming; also of the time he had been without seeing any land, at
    which the king was astonished. At the end the captain asked&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> if
    he would be pleased that two of his people <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>should go with him to the
    places where they lived, to see some of the things of his country. This
    the king granted, and I went with another.</p>

  <p>When I had landed, the king raised his hands to the sky, and turned to
    us two, and we did the same as he did; after that he took me by the
    hand, and one of his principal people took my companion, and led us
    under a place covered with canes, where there was a ballanghai, that is
    to say, a boat, eighty feet long or thereabouts, resembling a fusta. We
    sat with the king upon its poop, always conversing with him by signs,
    and his people stood up around us, with their swords, spears, and
    bucklers. Then the king ordered to be brought a dish of pig’s flesh and
    wine.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Their fashion of drinking is in this wise, they first raise
    their hands to heaven, then take the drinking vessel in their right
    hand, and extend the left hand closed towards the people. This the king
    did, and presented to me his fist, so that I thought that he wanted to
    strike me; I did the same thing towards him; so with this ceremony, and
    other signs of friendship, we banqueted, and afterwards supped with him.</p>

  <p>I ate flesh on Good Friday, not being able to do otherwise, and before
    the hour of supper, I gave several things to the king, which I had
    brought. There I wrote down several things as they name them in their
    language, and when the king and the others saw me write, and I told
    them their manner of speech, they were all astonished. When the hour
    for supper had come, they brought two large china dishes, of which one
    was full of rice, and the other of pig’s flesh, with its broth&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and
    sauce. We supped with the same signs and ceremonies, and then went to
    the king’s palace, which was made and built like a hay grange, covered
    with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>fig and palm leaves. It was built on great timbers high above
    the ground, and it was necessary to go up steps and ladders to it.
    Then the king made us sit on a cane mat, with our legs doubled as was
    the custom; after half an hour there was brought a dish of fish roast
    in pieces, and ginger fresh gathered that moment, and some wine. The
    eldest son of the king, who was the prince, came where we were, and the
    king told him to sit down near us, which he did; then two dishes were
    brought, one of fish, with its sauce, and the other of rice, and this
    was done for us to eat with the prince. My companion enjoyed the food
    and drink so much that he got drunk. They use for candles or torches
    the gum of a tree which is named Animé, wrapped up in leaves of palms
    or fig trees. The king made a sign that he wished to go to rest, and
    left with us the prince, with whom we slept on a cane mat, with some
    cushions and pillows of leaves. Next morning the king came and look
    me by the hand, and so we went to the place where we had supped, to
    breakfast, but the boat came to fetch us. The king, before we went
    away, was very gay, and kissed our hands, and we kissed his. There came
    with us a brother of his, the king of another island,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> accompanied
    by three men. The captain-general detained him to dine with us, and we
    gave him several things.</p>

  <p>In the island belonging to the king who came to the ship there are
    mines of gold, which they find in pieces as big as a walnut or an egg,
    by seeking in the ground. All the vessels which he makes use of are
    made of it, and also some parts of his house, which was well fitted up
    according to the custom of the country, and he was the handsomest man
    that we saw among these nations. He had very black hair coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> down to
    his shoulders, with a silk cloth on his head, and two large gold rings
    hanging from his ears, he had a cloth of cotton worked with silk, which
    covered him from the waist to the knees, at his side he wore a dagger,
    with a long handle which was all of gold, its sheath was of carved
    wood.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Besides he carried upon him scents of storax and benzoin.
    He was tawny and painted all over. The island of this king is named
    Zuluan and Calagan, and when these two kings wish to visit one another
    they come to hunt in this island where we were.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Of these kings the
    painted king is called Raia Calambu, and the other Raia Siani.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

  <p>On Sunday, the last day of March, and feast of Easter, the captain
    sent the chaplain ashore early to say mass, and the interpreter went
    with him to tell the king that they were not coming on shore to dine
    with him, but only to hear the mass. The king hearing that sent two
    dead pigs. When it was time for saying mass the captain went ashore
    with fifty men, not with their arms, but only with their swords, and
    dressed as well as each one was able to dress, and before the boats
    reached the shore our ships fired six cannon shots as a sign of peace.
    At our landing the two kings were there, and received our captain in
    a friendly manner, and placed him between them, and then we went to
    the place prepared for saying mass, which was not far from the shore.
    Before the mass began the captain threw a quantity of musk rose water
    on those two kings, and when the offertory of the mass came, the two
    kings went to kiss the cross like us, but they offered nothing, and at
    the elevation of the body of our Lord they were kneeling like us, and
    adored our Lord with joined hands. The ships fired all their artillery
    at the elevation of the body of our Lord. After mass had been said each
    one did the duty of a Christian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> receiving our Lord. After that the
    captain had some sword-play by his people, which gave great pleasure
    to the kings. Then he had a cross brought, with the nails and crown,
    to which the kings made reverence, and the captain had them told that
    these things which he showed them were the sign of the emperor his lord
    and master, from whom he had charge and commandment to place it in
    all places where he might go or pass by. He told them that he wished
    to place it in their country for their profit, because if there came
    afterwards any ships from Spain to those islands, on seeing this cross,
    they would know that we had been there, and therefore they would not
    cause them any displeasure to their persons nor their goods; and if
    they took any of their people, on showing them this sign, they would
    at once let them go. Besides this, the captain told them that it was
    necessary that this cross should be placed on the summit of the highest
    mountain in their country, so that seeing it every day they might adore
    it, and that if they did thus, neither thunder, lightning, nor the
    tempest could do them hurt. The kings thanked the captain, and said
    they would do it willingly. Then he asked whether they were Moors or
    Gentiles, and in what they believed. They answered that they did not
    perform any other adoration, but only joined their hands, looking up to
    heaven, and that they called their God, Aba. Hearing this, the captain
    was very joyful, on seeing that, the first king raised his hands to
    the sky and said that he wished it were possible for him to be able to
    show the affection which he felt towards him. The interpreter asked him
    for what reason there was so little to eat in that place, to which the
    king replied that he did not reside in that place except when he came
    to hunt and to see his brother, but that he lived in another island
    where he had all his family. Then the captain asked him if he had any
    enemies who made war upon him, and that if he had any he would go and
    defeat them with his men and ships, to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>put them under his obedience.
    The king thanked him, and answered that there were two islands the
    inhabitants of which were his enemies; however, that for the present it
    was not the time to attack them. The captain therefore said to him that
    if God permitted him to return another time to this country, he would
    bring so many men that he would put them by force under his obedience.
    Then he bade the interpreter tell them that he was going away to dine,
    and after that he would return to place the cross on the summit of
    the mountain. The two kings said they were content, and on that they
    embraced the captain, and he separated from them.</p>

  <p>After dinner we all returned in our dress coats&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>, and we went
    together with the two kings to the middle of the highest mountain we
    could find, and there the cross was planted. After that the two kings
    and the captain rested themselves; and, while conversing, I asked where
    was the best port for obtaining victuals. They replied that there were
    three, that is to say, Ceylon, Zzubu,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and Calaghan, but that Zzubu
    was the largest and of the most traffic. Then the kings offered to
    give him pilots to go to those ports, for which he thanked them, and
    deliberated to go there, for his ill-fortune&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> would have it so.
    After the cross had been planted on that mountain, each one said the
    Paternoster and Ave Maria, and adored it, and the kings did the like.
    Then we went down below to where their boats were. There the kings
    had brought some of the fruit called cocos and other things to make a
    collation and to refresh us. The captain, being desirous to depart the
    next day in the morning, asked the king for the pilots to conduct us to
    the above-mentioned ports, promising him to treat them like themselves,
    and that he would leave one of his own men as a hostage. The first
    king said that he would <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>go himself and conduct him to this port, and
    be his pilot, but that he should wait two days, until he had had his
    rice gathered in and done other things which he had to do, begging him
    to lend him some of his men so as to get done sooner. This the captain
    agreed to.</p>

  <p>This kind of people are gentle, and go naked, and are painted. They
    wear a piece of cloth made from a tree, like a linen cloth, round their
    body to cover their natural parts: they are great drinkers. The women
    are dressed in tree cloth from their waists downwards; their hair is
    black, and reaches down to the ground: they wear certain gold rings in
    their ears. These people chew most of their time a fruit which they
    call areca, which is something of the shape of a pear; they cut it
    in four quarters, and after they have chewed it for a long time they
    spit it out, from which afterwards they have their mouths very red.
    They find themselves the better from the use of this fruit because it
    refreshes them much, for this country is very hot, so that they could
    not live without it. In this island there is a great quantity of dogs,
    cats, pigs, fowls, and goats, rice, ginger, cocos, figs, oranges,
    lemons, millet, wax, and gold mines. This island is in nine degrees and
    two-thirds north latitude, and one hundred and sixty-two longitude&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
    from the line of demarcation: it is twenty-five leagues distant from
    the other island where we found the two fountains of fresh water. This
    island is named Mazzava.</p>

  <p>We remained seven days in this place; then we took the tack of
    Maestral, passing through the midst of five isles, that is to say,
    Ceylon, Bohol, Canighan, Baibai, and Satighan.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> In this island
    of Satighan is a kind of bird&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> called Barbastigly, which are as
    large as eagles. Of these we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>killed only one, because it was late. We
    ate it, and it had the taste of a fowl. There are also in this island
    doves, tortoises, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl,
    with a long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose. These
    they put a good arm’s length&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> under the sand in the sun, where they
    are hatched by the great heat which the heated sand gives out; and
    when these birds are hatched they push up&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> the sand and come out.
    These eggs are good to eat. From this island of Mazzabua&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> to that
    of Satighan there are twenty leagues, and on leaving Satighan we went
    by the west; but the King of Mazzabua could not follow us; therefore we
    waited for him near three islands, that is to say, Polo, Ticobon, and
    Pozzon. When the king arrived he was much astonished at our navigation,
    the captain-general bade him come on board his ship with some of his
    principal people, at which they were much pleased. Thus we went to
    Zzubu, which is fifteen leagues off from Satighan.</p>

  <p>Sunday, the 7th of April, about midday, we entered the port of
    Zzubu, having passed by many villages. There&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> we saw many houses
    which were built on trees. On approaching the principal town the
    captain-general commanded all his ships to hang out their flags. Then
    we lowered the sails in the fashion in which they are struck when going
    to fight, and he had all the artillery fired, at which the people of
    this place were greatly frightened. The captain sent a young man whom
    he had brought up,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> with the interpreter to the king of this island
    Zzubu. These having come to the town, found a great number of people
    and their king with them, all alarmed by the artillery which had been
    fired. But the interpreter reassured them, saying that it was the
    fashion and custom to fire artillery when they arrived at ports, to
    show signs of peace and friendship; and also, to do more honour to the
    king of the country, they had fired all the artillery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> The king and
    all his people were reassured. He then bade one of his principal men
    ask what we were seeking. The interpreter answered him that his master
    was captain of the greatest king in the world, and that he was going
    by the command of the said sovereign to discover the Molucca islands.
    However, on account of what he had heard where he had passed, and
    especially from the King of Mazzava, of his courtesy and good fame, he
    had wished to pass by his country to visit him, and also to obtain some
    refreshment of victuals for his merchandise. The king answered him that
    he was welcome, but that the custom was that all ships which arrived
    at his country or port paid tribute, and it was only four days since
    that a ship called the Junk of Ciama,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> laden with gold and slaves,
    had paid him his tribute, and, to verify what he said, he showed them
    a merchant of the said Ciama, who had remained there to trade with the
    gold and slaves. The interpreter said to him that this captain, on
    account of being captain of so great a king as his was, would not pay
    tribute to any sovereign in the world; and that if he wished for peace
    he would have peace, and if he wished for war he would have war. Then
    the merchant above-mentioned replied to the king in his own language,
    “Look well, oh king,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> what you will do, for these people are of
    those who have conquered Calicut, Malacca, and all greater India; if
    you entertain them well and treat them well you will find yourself the
    better for it, and if ill, it will be so much the worse for you, as
    they have done at Calicut and Malacca.” The interpreter, who understood
    all this discourse, said to them that the king, his master, was a good
    deal more powerful in ships and by land than the King of Portugal,
    and declared to him that he was the King of Spain and Emperor of all
    Christendom, wherefore, if he would not be his friend and treat his
    subjects well, he would another time send against <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>him so many men
    as to destroy him. Then the king answered that he would speak to his
    council, and give an answer the next day. Afterwards the king ordered
    a collation to be brought of several viands, all of meat, in porcelain
    dishes, with a great many vessels of wine. When the repast was over,
    our people returned, and related all to the captain; and the King of
    Mazzabua, who was on board the captain’s ship, and who was the first
    king after him of Zzubu, and the lord of several isles, wished to go on
    shore to relate to the king the politeness and courtesy of our captain.</p>

  <p>Monday morning our clerk went with the interpreter to the town of
    Zzubu, and the king, accompanied by the principal men of his kingdom,
    came to the open space, where we made our people sit down near him, and
    he asked whether there was more than one captain in all those ships,
    and whether he wished that the king should pay tribute to the emperor,
    his master, to which our people answered, no, but that the captain only
    wished to trade with the things which he had brought with the people
    of his country, and not with others. Then the king said that he was
    content, and as a greater sign of affection he sent him a little of
    his blood from his right arm, and wished he should do the like. Our
    people answered that he would do it. Besides that, he said that all the
    captains who came to his country had been accustomed to make a present
    to him, and he to them, and therefore they should ask their captain if
    he would observe the custom. Our people answered that he would; but
    as the king wished to keep up the custom, let him begin and make a
    present, and then the captain would do his duty.</p>

  <p>Tuesday morning following the King of Mazzava, with the Moor, came to
    the ship, and saluted the captain on behalf of the King of Zzubu, and
    said that the king was preparing a quantity of provisions, as much as
    he could, to make a present of to him, and that after dinner he would
    send two of his nephews, with others of his principal people, to make
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>peace with him. Then the captain had one of his men armed with his own
    armour, and told him that all of us would fight armed in that manner,
    at which the Moorish merchant was rather astonished; but the captain
    told him not to be afraid, and that our arms were soft to our friends
    and rough to our enemies; and that as a cloth wipes away the sweat from
    a man, so our arms destroy the enemies of our faith. The captain said
    this to the Moor, because he was more intelligent than the others, and
    for him to relate it all to the King of Zzubu.</p>

  <p>After dinner, the nephew of this king, who was a prince,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> with the
    King of Mazzava, the Moor, the governor, and the chief of police,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
    and eight of the principal men, came to the ship to make peace with us.
    The captain-general was sitting in a chair of red velvet, and near him
    were the principal men of the ships sitting in leather chairs, and the
    others on the ground on mats. Then the captain bade the interpreter ask
    the above-mentioned persons if it was their custom to speak in secret
    or in public, and whether the prince who was come with them had power
    to conclude peace. They answered yes, that they would speak in public,
    and that they had the power to conclude peace. The captain spoke at
    length on the subject of peace, and prayed God to confirm it in heaven.
    These people replied that they had never heard such words as these
    which the captain had spoken to them, and they took great pleasure
    in hearing them. The captain, seeing then that those people listened
    willingly to what was said to them, and that they gave good answers,
    began to say a great many more good things to induce them to become
    Christians. After many other subjects, the captain asked them who would
    succeed the king in their country after his death. They answered that
    the king had no son, but several daughters, and that this prince was
    his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>nephew, and had for a wife the king’s eldest daughter, and for
    the sake of that they called him prince. They also said that when the
    father and mother were old they took no further account of them, but
    their children commanded them. Upon which the captain told them how God
    had made heaven and earth and all other things in the world, and that
    He had commanded that everyone should render honour and obedience to
    his father and mother, and that whoever did otherwise was condemned to
    eternal fire. He then pointed out to them many other things concerning
    our faith. The people heard these things willingly, and besought the
    captain to leave them two men to teach and show them the Christian
    faith, and they would entertain them well with great honour. To this
    the captain answered that for the moment he could not leave them any of
    his people, but that if they wished to be Christians that his priest
    would baptise them, and that another time he would bring priests and
    preachers to teach them the faith. They then answered that they wished
    first to speak to their king, and then would become Christians. Each
    of us wept for the joy which we felt at the goodwill of these people,
    and the captain told them not to become Christians from fear of us, or
    to please us, but that if they wished to become Christian they must
    do it willingly, and for the love of God, for even though they should
    not become Christian, no displeasure would be done them, but those
    who became Christian would be more loved and better treated than the
    others. Then they all cried out with one voice, that they did not wish
    to become Christians from fear, nor from complaisance, but of their
    free will. The captain then said that if they became Christians he
    would leave them the arms which the Christians use, and that his king
    had commanded him so to do. At last they said they did not know what
    more to answer to so many good and beautiful words which he spoke to
    them, but that they placed themselves in his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>hands, and that he should
    do with them as with his own servants. Then the captain, with tears in
    his eyes, embraced them, and, taking the hand of the prince and that
    of the king, said to him that by the faith he had in God, and to his
    master the emperor, and by the habit of St. James which he wore, he
    promised them to cause them to have perpetual peace with the King of
    Spain, at which the prince and the others promised him the same. After
    peace had been concluded, the captain had refreshments served to them.
    The prince and the King of Mazzava, who was with him, presented to the
    captain on behalf of his king large baskets full of rice, pigs, goats,
    and fowls, and desired the captain to be told he should pardon them
    that their present was not as fine as was fitting for him. The captain
    gave to the prince some very fine cloth and a red cap, and a quantity
    of glass and a cup of gilt glass. Glasses are much prized in this
    country. To the other people belonging to the Prince he gave various
    things. Then he sent by me and another person to the King of Zzubu a
    robe of yellow and violet silk in the fashion of a Turkish jubbeh, a
    red cap, very fine, and certain pieces of glass, and had all of them
    put in a silver dish, and two gilt glasses.</p>

  <p>When we came to the town we found the King of Zzubu at his palace,
    sitting on the ground on a mat made of palm, with many people about
    him. He was quite naked, except that he had a cloth round his middle,
    and a loose wrapper round his head, worked with silk by the needle. He
    had a very heavy chain round his neck, and two gold rings hung in his
    ears with precious stones. He was a small and fat man, and his face
    was painted with fire in different ways. He was eating on the ground
    on another palm mat, and was then eating tortoise eggs in two china
    dishes, and he had four vessels full of palm wine, which he drank with
    a cane pipe.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> We made our obeisance, and presented to him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>what
    the captain had sent him, and told him through the interpreter that it
    was not as a return for his present which he had sent to the captain,
    but for the affection which he bore him. That done, his people told
    him all the good words and explanations of peace and religion which
    he had spoken to them. The king wished to detain us to supper, but we
    made our excuses and took leave of him. The prince, nephew of the king,
    conducted us to his house, and showed us four girls who played on four
    instruments, which were strange and very soft, and their manner of
    playing is rather musical. Afterwards he made us dance with them. These
    girls were naked except from the waist to the knees, where they wore
    a wrap made of the palm tree cloth, which covered their middles, and
    some were quite naked. There we made a repast, and then returned to the
    ships.</p>

  <p>Wednesday morning, because the night before one of our men had died,
    the interpreter and I, by order of the captain, went to ask the king
    for a place where we might bury the deceased. We found the king
    accompanied by a good many people, and, after paying him due honour,
    we told him of the death of our man, and that the captain prayed him
    that he might be put into the ground. He replied that if he and his
    people were ready to obey our master, still more reason was there
    for his land and country being subject to him. After that we said we
    wished to consecrate the grave in our fashion and place a cross on
    it. The sovereign said that he was content, and that he would worship
    that cross as we did. The deceased was buried in the middle of the
    open space of the town, as decently as possible, and performing the
    above-mentioned ceremonies to set them a good example, and in the
    evening we buried another. This done, we brought a good quantity of
    merchandise into the town of this king, and placed it in a house, and
    he took it under his charge and promised that no one would do harm or
    injury to the king. Four of our men were chosen to despatch <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>and sell
    this merchandise. These people live with justice, and good weight and
    measure, loving peace, and are people who love ease and pleasure.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
    They have wooden scales, after the fashion of those of north of the
    Loire,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> for weighing their merchandise. Their houses are made of
    wood and beams and canes, founded on piles, and are very high, and
    must be entered by means of ladders; their rooms are like ours, and
    underneath they keep their cattle, such as pigs, goats, and fowls.
    The young people sound bag-pipes,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> made like ours, and call them
    Subin.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

  <p>In this island of the king’s there is a kind of animal carrying a shell
    called carniolle, fine to look at, which cause the whale to die. For
    the whale swallows them alive; then, when they are inside its body,
    they come out of their shell and go and eat the whale’s heart: and the
    people of this country find this animal alive inside the whale. These
    animals, the carniolles, have the teeth and skin black, and their shell
    is white. Their flesh is good to eat, and they call them Laghan.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

  <p>The following Friday we showed them a shop full of our merchandise,
    which was of various strange sorts, at which they were surprised.
    For metal, iron, and other big goods they gave us gold, and for the
    other small and sundry goods they gave us rice, pigs, goats, and other
    provisions. They gave us ten weights of gold for fourteen pounds of
    iron: each weight is a ducat and a half. The captain-general would not
    allow a large quantity of gold to be taken, so that the sailors should
    not sell what belonged to them too <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
    cheap from thirst for gold, and lest by that means he might be
    constrained to do likewise with his merchandise, for he wished to sell
    it better.</p>

    <p>Saturday following a scaffolding
    was made in the open space, fitted with tapestry and palm branches,
    because the king had promised our captain to become Christian on
    Sunday. He told him not to be afraid when our artillery fired on that
    day, for it was the custom to load it on those feasts without firing
    stones or other balls.</p>

  <p>Sunday morning, the fourteenth day of April, we went on shore, forty
    men, of whom two were armed, who marched before us, following the
    standard of our king emperor. When we landed the ships discharged
    all their artillery, and from fear of it the people ran away in all
    directions. The captain and the king embraced one another, and then
    joyously we went near the scaffolding, where the captain and the king
    sat on two chairs, one covered with red, the other with violet velvet.
    The principal men sat on cushions, and the others on mats, after the
    fashion of the country. Then the captain began to speak to the king
    through the interpreter to incite him to the faith of Jesus Christ,
    and told him that if he wished to be a good Christian, as he had said
    the day before, that he must burn all the idols of his country, and,
    instead of them, place a cross, and that everyone should worship it
    every day on their knees, and their hands joined to heaven: and he
    showed him how he ought every day to make the sign of the cross. To
    that the king and all his people answered that they would obey the
    commands of the captain and do all that he told them. The captain
    took the king by the hand, and they walked about on the scaffolding,
    and when he was baptised he said that he would name him&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Don
    Charles, as the emperor his sovereign was named; and he named the
    prince Don Fernand, after the brother of the emperor, and the King of
    Mazzava <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>Jehan: to the Moor he gave the name of Christopher, and to
    the others each a name of his fancy. Thus, before mass, there were
    fifty men baptised. After mass had been heard the captain invited the
    king and his other principal men to dine with him, but he would not.
    He accompanied the captain, however, to the beach, and on his arrival
    there the ships fired all their artillery. Then, embracing one another,
    they took leave.</p>

  <p>After dinner our chaplain and some of us went on shore to baptise the
    queen. She came with forty ladies, and we conducted them on to the
    scaffolding; then made her sit down on a cushion, and her women around
    her, until the priest was ready. During that time they showed her an
    image of our Lady, of wood, holding her little child, which was very
    well made, and a cross. When she saw it, she had a greater desire to
    be a Christian, and, asking for baptism, she was baptised and named
    Jehanne, like the mother of the emperor. The wife of the prince,
    daughter of this queen, had the name of Catherine, the Queen of Mazzava
    Isabella, and the others each their name. That day we baptised eight
    hundred persons of men, women, and children. The Queen was young and
    handsome, covered with a black and white sheet; she had the mouth and
    nails very red, and wore on her head a large hat made of leaves of
    palm, with a crown over it made of the same leaves, like that of the
    Pope. After that she begged us to give her the little wooden boy to put
    in the place of the idols.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This we did, and she went away. In the
    evening the king and queen, with several of their people, came to the
    sea beach, where the captain had some of the large artillery fired, in
    which they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>took great pleasure.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The captain and the king called
    one another brother.</p>

  <p>At last, in eight days, all the inhabitants of this island were
    baptised, and some belonging to the neighbouring islands. In one of
    these we burned a village because the inhabitants would not obey either
    the king or us. There we planted a cross because the people were
    Gentiles: if they had been Moors, we should have erected a column, as a
    sign of their hardness of heart, because the Moors are more difficult
    to convert than the Gentiles. The captain-general went ashore every
    day to hear mass, to which there came many of the new Christians, to
    whom he explained various points of our religion. One day the queen
    came with all her state. She was preceded by three damsels, who carried
    in their hands three of her hats: she was dressed in black and white,
    with a large silk veil with gold stripes, which covered her head and
    shoulders. Very many women followed her, with their heads covered with
    a small veil, and a hat above that: the rest of their bodies and feet
    were naked, except a small wrapper of palm cloth which covered their
    natural parts. Their hair fell flowing over their shoulders. The queen,
    after making a bow to the altar, sat upon a cushion of embroidered
    silk, and the captain sprinkled over her and over some of her ladies
    rose water and musk, a perfume which pleases the ladies of this country
    very much. The captain on that occasion approved of the gift which I
    had made to the queen of the image of the Infant Jesus, and recommended
    her to put it in the place of her idols, because it was a remembrancer
    of the Son of God. She promised to do all this, and to keep it with
    much care.</p>

  <p>In order that the king might be more respected and obeyed, the
    captain-general got him to come one day at the hour of mass with his
    silk robe, and summoned his two brothers, one named Bondara, who was
    the father of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>prince, and the other named Cadaro, and some of his
    chief men, whose names were Simiut, Sibuaia, Sisacai,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Magalibe,
    and others whom it is unnecessary to name separately; and he made
    them all swear to be obedient to their king, whose hand they all of
    them kissed. He then asked the king to swear that he would always be
    obedient and faithful to the King of Spain, and he took the oath. Then
    the captain drew a sword before the image of the Virgin Mary, and said
    to the king that when such an oath had been taken by anyone, he should
    rather die than be wanting to his oath. After that he himself promised
    to be always faithful to him, swearing by the image of our Lady, by the
    life of the emperor his sovereign, and by the habit which he wore. He
    then made a present to the king of a velvet chair, and told him that
    wherever he went he should always have it carried before him by some of
    his attendants, and showed him the way in which it should be carried.
    The king told the captain that he would do all this on account of the
    affection which he bore him, of which he wished to give him a token,
    preparing for that purpose some jewels to present to him; these were
    two rather large gold rings for the ears, two others for the arms,
    and two for the ancles, all of them adorned with precious stones. The
    finest ornaments of the kings of these countries consist in these
    rings, for otherwise they go naked and barefooted, with only a piece of
    cloth from the waist to the knees.</p>

  <p>The captain-general, who had informed the king and all those who had
    been baptised of the obligation they were under of burning their idols,
    which they had promised to do, seeing that they retained them and made
    them offerings of meat, reproved them severely for it. They thought to
    excuse themselves sufficiently by saying that they did not do that now
    on their own account, but for a sick person, for the idols to restore
    him his health. This sick man was a brother of the prince, and was
    reputed to be the most valiant and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>wise man in the island, and his
    illness was so severe that for four days he had not spoken. Having
    heard this, the captain, seized with zeal for religion, said that if
    they had a true faith in Jesus Christ, they should burn all the idols,
    and the sick man should be baptised, and he would be immediately cured,
    of which he was so certain that he consented to lose his head if the
    miracle did not take place. The king promised that all this should be
    done, because he truly believed in Jesus Christ. Then we arranged, with
    all the pomp that was possible, a procession from the place to the
    house of the sick man. We went there, and indeed found him unable to
    speak or to move. We baptised him, with two of his wives and ten girls.
    The captain then asked him how he felt, and he at once spoke, and said
    that by the grace of Our Lord he was well enough. This great miracle
    was done under our eyes. The captain, on hearing him speak, gave great
    thanks to God. He gave him a refreshing drink to take, and afterwards
    sent to his house a mattress, two sheets, a covering of yellow wool,
    and a cushion, and he continued to send him, until he was quite well,
    refreshing drinks of almonds, rosewater, rosoglio, and some sweet
    preserves.</p>

  <p>On the fifth day the convalescent rose from his bed, and as soon as
    he could walk, he had burned, in the presence of the king and of all
    the people, an idol which some old women had concealed in his house.
    He also caused to be destroyed several temples constructed on the sea
    shore, in which people were accustomed to eat the meat offered to
    the idols. The inhabitants applauded this, and, shouting “Castile,
    Castile,” helped to throw them down, and declared that if God gave them
    life they would burn all the idols they could find, even if they were
    in the king’s own house.</p>

  <p>These idols are made of wood, they are concave or hollowed out behind,
    they have the arms and legs spread out, and the feet turned upwards;
    they have a large face, with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>four very large teeth like those of a
    wild boar, and they are all painted.</p>

  <p>Since I have spoken of the idols, it may please your illustrious
    Highness to have an account of the ceremony with which, in this island,
    they bless the pig. They begin by sounding some great drums (tamburi),
    they then bring three large dishes, two are filled with cakes of rice
    and cooked millet rolled up in leaves, and roast fish, in the third
    are Cambay clothes, and two strips of palm cloth. A cloth of Cambay
    is spread out on the ground: then two old women come, each of whom
    has in her hand a reed trumpet. They step upon the cloth and make
    an obeisance to the Sun: they then clothe themselves with the above
    mentioned cloths. The first of these puts on her head a handkerchief
    which she ties on her forehead so as to make two horns, and taking
    another handkerchief in her hand, dances and sounds her trumpet, and
    invokes the Sun. The second old woman takes one of the strips of palm
    cloth, and dances, and also sounds her trumpet; thus they dance and
    sound their trumpets for a short space of time, saying several things
    to the sun. The first old woman then drops the handkerchief she has
    in her hand, and takes the other strip of cloth, and both together
    sounding their trumpets, dance for a long time round the pig which is
    bound on the ground. The first one always speaks in a low tone to the
    sun, and the second answers her. The second old woman then presents
    a cup of wine to the first, who, whilst they both continue their
    address to the sun, brings the cup four or five times near her mouth as
    though going to drink, and meanwhile sprinkles the wine on the heart
    of the pig. She then gives up the cup, and receives a lance which she
    brandishes, whilst still dancing and reciting, and four or five times
    directs the lance at the pig’s heart, at last with a sudden and well
    aimed blow she pierces it through and through. She withdraws the lance
    from the wound, which is then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>closed and dressed with herbs. During
    the ceremony a torch is always burning, and the old woman who pierced
    the pig takes and puts it out with her mouth, the other old woman dips
    the end of her trumpet in the pig’s blood, and with it marks with blood
    the forehead of her husband, and of her companion, and then of the rest
    of the people. But they did not come and do this to us. That done the
    old women took off their robes, and ate what was in the two dishes,
    inviting only women to join them. After that they get the hair off the
    pig with fire. Only old women are able to consecrate the boar in this
    manner, and this animal is never eaten unless it is killed in this
    manner.</p>

  <h4>(<i>Here follows an account of a custom, for a description of which see
    De Morga’s Philippine Islands, p. 304.</i>)</h4>

  <p>When our people went on shore by day or by night, they always met with
    some one who invited them to eat and drink. They only half cook their
    victuals, and salt them very much, which makes them drink a great deal;
    and they drink much with reeds, sucking the wine from the vessels.
    Their repasts always last from five to six hours.</p>

  <p>When one of their chiefs dies they always use the following funeral
    ceremonies, of which I was witness. The most respected women of the
    country came to the house of the deceased, in the midst of which lay
    the corpse in a chest; round which were stretched cords after the
    manner of an enclosure, and many branches of trees were tied to these
    cords: a strip of cotton was fastened to each of these branches like a
    pennant. Under these the women I have mentioned sat down covered with
    white cotton cloth. Each of them had a damsel who fanned her with a
    palm fan. The other women sat sadly round the room. Meanwhile a woman
    cut off by degrees the hair of the dead man with a knife: another who
    had been his principal wife, lay extended on him, with her mouth hands
    and feet on the mouth hands <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>and feet of the dead man. When the first
    woman cut off the hair, she wept, and when she stopped cutting, she
    sung. Round the room there were many vases of porcelain, with embers
    in them, on which, from time to time, they threw myrrh, storax, and
    benzoin, which gave out a good and strong smell in the room. These
    ceremonies last for five or six days, during which the corpse is kept
    in the house, and I believe that they anoint it with oil of camphor
    to preserve it. They afterwards put it in a chest, closed with wooden
    bolts, and place it in an enclosed place covered with logs of wood.</p>

  <p>The islanders told us that every evening towards midnight, there used
    to come to the city, a black bird of the size of a crow, which perching
    on the houses whistled, and caused all the dogs to howl, and these
    double cries lasted four or five hours. They would never tell us the
    cause of that phenomenon, of which we also were witnesses.</p>

  <p>Friday, the 26th of April, Zula, who was one of the principal men or
    chiefs of the island of Matan, sent to the captain a son of his with
    two goats to make a present of them, and to say that if he did not do
    all that he had promised, the cause of that was another chief named
    Silapulapu, who would not in any way obey the King of Spain, and had
    prevented him from doing so: but that if the captain would send him the
    following night one boat full of men to give him assistance, he would
    fight and subdue his rival. On the receipt of this message, the captain
    decided to go himself with three boats. We entreated him much not to
    go to this enterprise in person, but he as a good shepherd would not
    abandon his flock.</p>

  <p>We set out from Zubu at midnight, we were sixty men armed with corslets
    and helmets; there were with us the Christian king, the prince, and
    some of the chief men, and many others divided among twenty or thirty
    balangai. We arrived at Matan three hours before daylight. The captain
    before attacking wished to attempt gentle means, and sent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>on shore
    the Moorish merchant to tell those islanders who were of the party of
    Cilapulapu, that if they would recognise the Christian king as their
    sovereign, and obey the King of Spain, and pay us the tribute which
    had been asked, the captain would become their friend, otherwise we
    should prove how our lances wounded. The islanders were not terrified,
    they replied that if we had lances, so also had they, although only of
    reeds, and wood hardened with fire. They asked however that we should
    not attack them by night, but wait for daylight, because they were
    expecting reinforcements, and would be in greater number. This they
    said with cunning, to excite us to attack them by night, supposing
    that we were ready; but they wished this because they had dug ditches
    between their houses and the beach, and they hoped that we should fall
    into them.</p>

  <p>We however waited for daylight; we then leaped into the water up to
    our thighs, for on account of the shallow water and the rocks the
    boats could not come close to the beach, and we had to cross two good
    crossbow shots through the water before reaching it. We were forty-nine
    in number, the other eleven remained in charge of the boats. When we
    reached land we found the islanders fifteen hundred in number, drawn
    up in three squadrons; they came down upon us with terrible shouts,
    two squadrons attacking us on the flanks, and the third in front.
    The captain then divided his men in two bands. Our musketeers and
    crossbow-men fired for half an hour from a distance, but did nothing,
    since the bullets and arrows, though they passed through their shields
    made of thin wood, and perhaps wounded their arms, yet did not stop
    them. The captain shouted not to fire, but he was not listened to. The
    islanders seeing that the shots of our guns did them little or no harm
    would not retire, but shouted more loudly, and springing from one side
    to the other to avoid our shots, they at the same time drew nearer to
    us, throwing arrows, javelins, spears hardened in fire, stones, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>even mud, so that we could hardly defend ourselves. Some of them cast
    lances pointed with iron at the captain-general.</p>

  <p>He then, in order to disperse this multitude and to terrify them, sent
    some of our men to set fire to their houses, but this rendered them
    more ferocious. Some of them ran to the fire, which consumed twenty or
    thirty houses, and there killed two of our men. The rest came down upon
    us with greater fury; they perceived that our bodies were defended,
    but that the legs were exposed, and they aimed at them principally.
    The captain had his right leg pierced by a poisoned arrow, on which
    account he gave orders to retreat by degrees; but almost all our men
    took to precipitate flight, so that there remained hardly six or eight
    of us with him. We were oppressed by the lances and stones which the
    enemy hurled at us, and we could make no more resistance. The bombards
    which we had in the boats were of no assistance to us, for the shoal
    water kept them too far from the beach. We went thither, retreating
    little by little, and still fighting, and we had already got to the
    distance of a crossbow shot from the shore, having the water up to our
    knees, the islanders following and picking up again the spears which
    they had already cast, and they threw the same spear five or six times;
    as they knew the captain they aimed specially at him, and twice they
    knocked the helmet off his head. He, with a few of us, like a good
    knight, remained at his post without choosing to retreat further. Thus
    we fought for more than an hour, until an Indian succeeded in thrusting
    a cane lance into the captain’s face. He then, being irritated,
    pierced the Indian’s breast with his lance, and left it in his body,
    and trying to draw his sword he was unable to draw it more than half
    way, on account of a javelin wound which he had received in the right
    arm. The enemies seeing this all rushed against him, and one of them
    with a great sword, like a great scimetar&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> gave him a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>great blow
    on the left leg, which brought the captain down on his face, then the
    Indians threw themselves upon him, and ran him through with lances and
    scimetars, and all the other arms which they had, so that they deprived
    of life our mirror, light, comfort, and true guide. Whilst the Indians
    were thus overpowering him, several times he turned round towards us
    to see if we were all in safety, as though his obstinate fight had no
    other object than to give an opportunity for the retreat of his men. We
    who fought to extremity, and who were covered with wounds, seeing that
    he was dead, proceeded to the boats which were on the point of going
    away. This fatal battle was fought on the 27th of April of 1521, on a
    Saturday; a day which the captain had chosen himself, because he had
    a special devotion to it. There perished with him eight of our men,
    and four of the Indians, who had become Christians; we had also many
    wounded, amongst whom I must reckon myself. The enemy lost only fifteen
    men.</p>

  <p>He died; but I hope that your illustrious highness will not allow his
    memory to be lost, so much the more since I see revived in you the
    virtue of so great a captain, since one of his principal virtues was
    constance in the most adverse fortune. In the midst of the sea he was
    able to endure hunger better than we. Most versed in nautical charts,
    he knew better than any other the true art of navigation, of which it
    is a certain proof that he knew by his genius, and his intrepidity,
    without any one having given him the example, how to attempt the
    circuit of the globe, which he had almost completed.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

  <p>The Christian king could indeed have given us aid, and would have done
    so; but our captain far from forseeing that which happened, when he
    landed with his men, had charged him not to come out of his balangai,
    wishing that he should <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>stay there to see how we fought. When he knew
    how the captain had died he wept bitterly for him.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the king himself, with our consent, sent to tell the
    inhabitants of Matan, that if they would give up to us the body of our
    captain, and of our other companions who were killed in this battle, we
    would give them as much merchandise as they might wish for; but they
    answered that on no account would they ever give up that man, but they
    wished to preserve him as a monument of their triumph. When the death
    of the captain was known, those who were in the city to trade, had all
    the merchandise at once transported to the ships. We then elected in
    the place of the captain, Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese, and a relation
    of the captain’s, and Juan Serrano a Spaniard.</p>

  <p>Our interpreter, who was a slave of the captain-general, and was named
    Henry, having been slightly wounded in the battle, would not go ashore
    any more for the things which we required, but remained all day idle,
    and wrapped up in his mat (Schiavina). Duarte Barbosa, the commander
    of the flag ship, found fault with him, and told him that though his
    master was dead, he had not become free on that account, but that when
    we returned to Spain he would return him to Doña Beatrice, the widow
    of the captain-general; at the same time he threatened to have him
    flogged, if he did not go on shore quickly, and do what was wanted for
    the service of the ships. The slave rose up, and did as though he did
    not care much for these affronts and threats; and having gone on shore,
    he informed the Christian king that we were thinking of going away
    soon, but that if he would follow his advice, he might become master of
    all our goods and of the ships themselves. The King of Zubu listened
    favourably to him, and they arranged to betray us. After that the slave
    returned on board, and showed more intelligence and attention than he
    had done before.</p>

  <p>Wednesday morning, the 1st of May, the Christian king <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>sent to tell
    the two commanders that the jewels prepared as presents for the King
    of Spain were ready, and he invited them to come that same day to dine
    with him, with some of his most honoured companions, and he would
    give them over to them. The commanders went with twenty-four others,
    and amongst them was our astrologer named San Martin of Seville.
    I could not go because I was swelled with a wound from a poisoned
    arrow in the forehead. Juan Carvalho, with the chief of police, who
    also were invited, turned back, and said that they had suspected
    some bad business, because they had seen the man who had recovered
    from illness by a miracle, leading away the priest to his own house.
    They had hardly spoken these words when we heard great lamentations
    and cries. We quickly got up the anchors and, coming closer to the
    beach, we fired several shots with the cannon at the houses. There
    then appeared on the beach Juan Serrano, in his shirt, wounded and
    bound, who entreated us, as loudly as he could, not to fire any more,
    or else he would be massacred. We asked him what had become of his
    companions and the interpreter, and he said that all had been slain
    except the interpreter. He then entreated us to ransom him with some
    merchandise; but Juan Carvalho, although he was his gossip, joined
    with some others, refused to do it, and they would not allow any boat
    to go ashore, so that they might remain masters of the ships. Serrano
    continued his entreaties and lamentations, saying, that if we departed
    and abandoned him there, he would soon be killed; and after that he saw
    his lamentations were useless, he added that he prayed God to ask for
    an account of his life at the day of Judgment from Juan Carvalho, his
    gossip.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Notwithstanding, we sailed immediately; and I never heard
    any more news of him.</p>

  <p>In this island of Zubu there are dogs and cats, and other animals,
    whose flesh is eaten; there is also rice, millet, panicum, and maize;
    there are also figs, oranges, lemons, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>sugar-canes, cocos, gourds,
    ginger, honey, and other such things; they also make palm-wine of
    many qualities. Gold is abundant. The island is large, and has a
    good port with two entrances: one to the west, and the other to the
    east-north-east. It is in ten degrees north latitude and 154 east
    longitude from the line of demarcation.</p>

  <p>In this island there are several towns, each of which has its principal
    men or chiefs. Here are the names of the towns and their chiefs:—</p>

  <p>Cingapola: its chiefs are Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaninga, Cimaticat,
    Cicanbul.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

  <p>Mandani: its chief is Aponoaan.</p>

  <p>Lalan: its chief is Teten.</p>

  <p>Lalutan: its chief is Japau.</p>

  <p>Lubucin: its chief is Cilumai.</p>

  <p class="noindent">All these countries were in obedience to us, and paid a kind of tribute.</p>

  <p>Near to Zubu there is, as we said, the island of Matan, the most
    considerable town of which is called Matan, and its chiefs are Zula and
    Cilapulapu. The village, which we burned on the occasion of the fatal
    battle, is named Bulaia.</p>

  <p>In this island, before we lost our captain-general, we had news of
    Maluco.</p>

  <h4 class="smcap">Departure from Zubu.</h4>

  <p>When we were at a distance of eighteen leagues from the island of Zubu,
    near the head of another island called Bohol,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> in the midst of that
    archipelago, seeing that our crews were too much reduced in number,
    so that they were not sufficient for managing all the three ships, we
    burned the <cite>Conception</cite> after transporting into the other two
    all that it contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> that was serviceable. We then took the S.S.W.
    course, coasting along an island called Panilongon,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> where the
    people were black as in Ethiopia.</p>

  <p>We then arrived at a large island,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> the king of which having come
    on board our ship, in order to show that he made alliance with us and
    would be friendly, drew blood from his left hand, and stained with it
    his breast, his face, and the tip of his tongue. We then did likewise,
    and when the king went away, I alone accompanied him on shore to see
    the island.</p>

  <p>We entered a river&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> where we met many fishermen, who presented some
    of their fish to the king. He then took off the cloth which covered his
    middle, and some of his chief men who were with him did the same, they
    then all began to row and to sing. Passing near many houses, which were
    on the brink of the river, we arrived at two hours of the night&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
    at the house of the king, which was two leagues from the mouth of the
    river where the ships were.</p>

  <p>When we reached the house, people came to meet us with many torches,
    made of canes and palm leaves, full of the before-mentioned gum, called
    <i>anime</i>. Whilst supper was being got ready, the king, with two of
    his chiefs, and two rather handsome ladies, drank a large vase full of
    palm wine, without eating anything. I, excusing myself saying that I
    had already supped, only drank once. In drinking they use the ceremony
    which I have already described in speaking of the King of Massava.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
    Then the supper was brought, which consisted of rice and fish, very
    much salted, in porcelain dishes. Rice with them takes the place of
    bread. They cook it in the following manner, which is common to all
    these countries. They place inside an earthen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>pot like ours, a large
    leaf which lines it all round internally, then they put in the water
    and the rice, and cover up the pot. They let it boil until the rice has
    taken the consistency of bread, and then they take it out in pieces.</p>

  <p>When the supper was over the king had brought a cane mat, and a mat of
    palm leaf, with a cushion of leaves, and this was to be my bed. I slept
    there with one of his chiefs. The king with the two ladies went to
    sleep in another place.</p>

  <p>When it was day, whilst breakfast was being prepared, I went to take
    a turn in the island, and entered several houses, constructed like
    those of the neighbouring islands; I saw there a good many utensils
    of gold, but very little victuals. I returned to the king’s house,
    and we breakfasted with rice and fish. I succeeded in making the king
    understand by signs, that I should like to see the queen; and he made
    a sign to me that he was content, and we set out together to the top
    of a hill, under which her house was placed. I entered the house and
    made her an obeisance, she did likewise to me. I sat down by the side
    of her; she was weaving a palm mat to sleep upon. Throughout her house
    were seen porcelain vases suspended to the walls, and four metal
    timbals, of which one was very large, another of middle size, and two
    small ones, and she amused herself by playing on them. There were many
    male and female slaves for her service. We asked leave and returned to
    the king’s house, who immediately ordered a refreshment of sugar canes.</p>

  <p>After midday, as I wished to return to the ships, the king, with the
    other chief men of the island, desired to accompany me in the same
    <i>balangai</i>, going by the same river; on its right bank I saw on
    an eminence three men hanging to a tree, the branches of which had
    been cut off. I asked of the king what those unhappy people were, he
    answered me that they were malefactors and thieves. These people go
    naked like their neighbours. In this island are found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>pigs, goats,
    fowls, rice, ginger, find other things which were common to the islands
    named before. That which is most abundant is gold. They showed me
    certain valleys, making signs that there was more gold there than hairs
    on the head, but that as they had not iron to dig it out, it required
    great labour to acquire it, and which they did not choose to undergo.
    The king is named Raja Calanao.</p>

  <p>This part of the island called Chipit is the same land as Butuan and
    Calagan, it passes above Bohol, and borders on Massava. Its port is
    good enough; it is in 8° N. latitude, and 167° of longitude from the
    line of demarcation; it is fifty leagues distance from Zubu. Towards
    the North-west is the island of Lozon,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> which is at two days’
    distance; a large island, to which come to trade every year six or
    eight junks of the people called Lequii.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

  <p>On leaving this place, and taking our course between west and
    south-west, we touched at an almost uninhabited island, which
    afterwards we learned was named Cagayan. The few people there are
    Moors, who have been banished from an island called Burné.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> They
    go naked like the others, and carry blow-pipes with small quivers at
    their sides full of arrows, and a herb with which they poison them.
    They have daggers, with hilts adorned with gold and precious stones,
    lances, bucklers, and small cuirasses of buffaloes’ hide. These people
    took us for something Divine or holy. There are some very large trees
    in this island, but little victuals. It is in 7° 30′ North latitude,
    and forty-three leagues from Chipit.</p>

  <p>Continuing our voyage we changed our course to between West and
    North-west, and after running twenty-five leagues, we arrived at a
    large island, which we found well provided with victuals, and it was
    great good fortune for us <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>since we were so reduced by hunger and so
    badly supplied, that we were several times on the point of abandoning
    the ships, and establishing ourselves on some land, in order to live.
    In this island, which we learned was named Palaoan, we found pigs,
    goats, fowls, yams, bananas of various kinds, some of which are half a
    cubit long, and as thick as the arm, others are only a span long, and
    others are still smaller, and these are the best; they have cocoa nuts,
    sugar canes, and certain roots like turnips. They cook rice under the
    fire in bamboo canes, or wooden vessels, and it keeps longer than that
    cooked in earthen pots. They draw from the rice with a kind of alembic
    a wine that is better and stronger than the palm wine. In short we
    found this island to be a promised land.</p>

  <p>We presented ourselves to the king, who contracted alliance and
    friendship with us, and to assure us of it, he asked for one of our
    knives, with which he drew blood from his breast, with which he touched
    his forehead and tongue. We repeated the same ceremony.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

  <p>The people of Palaoan go naked like the other islanders, they almost
    all till their own fields. They have blow-pipes, with thick arrows more
    than a span in length, with a point like that of a harpoon; some have
    a point made with a fish bone, and others are of reed, poisoned with a
    certain herb; the arrows are not trimmed with feathers, but with a soft
    light wood. At the foot of the blow-pipe they bind a piece of iron, by
    means of which, when they have no more arrows, they wield the blow-pipe
    like a lance. They like to adorn themselves with rings and chains of
    gimp and with little bells, but above all they are fond of brass wire,
    with which they bind their fish hooks. They have some rather large
    domestic cocks, which, from some superstition, they do not eat, but
    they keep them for fighting; on such occasions they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>make bets and
    offer prizes, which are acquired by the owner of the conquering cock.</p>

  <p>Going from Palaoan towards the South-west, after a run of ten leagues,
    we reached another island.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Whilst coasting it, it seemed in a
    certain manner to go forward;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> we coasted it for a distance of
    fully fifty&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> leagues, until we found a port. We had hardly reached
    the port when the heavens were darkened, and the lights of St. Elmo
    appeared on our masts.</p>

  <p>The next day the king of that island sent a prahu to the ships; it was
    very handsome, with its prow and stern ornamented with gold; on the
    bow fluttered a white and blue flag, with a tuft of peacock’s feathers
    at the top of the staff; there were in the prahu some people playing
    on pipes and drums, and many other persons. Two almadias followed the
    prahu; these are fishermen’s boats, and a prahu is a kind of fusta.
    Eight old men of the chiefs of the island came into the ships, and
    sat down upon a carpet on the poop, and presented a painted wooden
    vase full of betel and areca (fruits which they constantly chew), with
    orange and jessamine flowers, and covered over with a cloth of yellow
    silk. They also gave two cages full of fowls, two goats, three vessels
    full of wine, distilled from rice, and some bundles of sugar cane. They
    did the same to the other ship; and embracing us they departed. Their
    rice wine is clear like water, but so strong that many of our men were
    intoxicated. They call it arak.</p>

  <p>Six days later the king again sent three very ornamented prahus, which
    came playing pipes and drums and cymbals, and going round the ships,
    their crews saluted us with their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>cloth caps, which hardly cover the
    tops of their heads. We saluted them, firing the bombards without
    stones. Then they made us a present of various victuals, but all made
    with rice, either wrapped in leaves in the form of a long cylinder, or
    in the shape of a sugar loaf, or in the shape of a cake, with eggs and
    honey. They then said that their king was well pleased that we should
    make provisions here of wood and water, and that we might traffic at
    our pleasure with the islanders. Having heard this, seven of us entered
    one of the prahus, taking with us presents for the king, and for some
    of his court. The present intended for the king consisted in a Turkish
    coat of green velvet, a chair of violet coloured velvet, five ells of
    red cloth, a cap, a gilt goblet, and a vase of glass, with its cover,
    three packets of paper, and a gilt pen and ink case. We took for the
    queen three ells of yellow cloth, a pair of slippers, ornamented with
    silver, and a silver case full of pins. For the king’s governor or
    minister three ells of red cloth, a cap, and a gilt goblet; and for the
    herald who had come in the prahu, a coat of the Turkish fashion, of red
    and green colours, a cap and a packet of paper. For the other seven
    chief men who had come with him, we prepared presents; for one cloth,
    for another a cap, and for each a packet of paper. Having made these
    preparations, we entered the prahu, and departed.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at the city, we were obliged to wait about two hours
    in the prahu, until there came thither two elephants covered with
    silk, and twelve men, each of whom carried a porcelain vase covered
    with silk, for conveying and wrapping up our presents. We mounted
    the elephants, and those twelve men preceded us, carrying the vases
    with our presents. We went as far as the house of the governor, who
    gave us supper with many sorts of viands. There we slept through the
    night, on mattresses filled with cotton, and covered with silk, with
    sheets of Cambay stuff.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    On the following day we remained doing nothing
    in the house till midday, and after that we set out for the king’s
    palace. We were again mounted upon the elephants, and the men with the
    presents preceded us as before. From the governor’s house to that of
    the king, all the streets were full of men armed with swords, spears,
    and bucklers, the king having so commanded. We entered the palace
    still mounted upon the elephants; we then dismounted, and ascended a
    staircase, accompanied by the governor and some of the chief men, and
    entered a large room full of courtiers, whom we should call the barons
    of the kingdom; there we sat upon a carpet, and the vases with the
    presents were placed near us.</p>

  <p>At the end of this hall there was another a little higher, but not so
    large, all hung with silk stuffs, among which were two curtains of
    brocade hung up, and leaving open two windows which gave light to the
    room.</p>

  <p>There were placed three hundred men of the king’s guard with naked
    daggers in their hands, which they held on their thighs. At the end
    of this second hall was a great opening, covered with a curtain of
    brocade, and on this being raised we saw the king sitting at a table,
    with a little child of his, chewing betel. Behind him there were only
    women.</p>

  <p>Then one of the chief men informed us that we could not speak to the
    king, but that if we wished to convey anything to him, we were to say
    it to him, and he would say it to a chief or courtier of higher rank,
    who would lay it before a brother of the governor, who was in the
    smaller room, and they by means of a blow pipe placed in a fissure in
    the wall would communicate our thoughts to a man who was near the king,
    and from him the king would understand them. He taught us meanwhile
    to make three obeisances to the king, with the hands joined above the
    head, raising first one then the other foot, and then to kiss the hands
    to him. This is the royal obeisance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>Then by the mode which had been
    indicated to us, we gave him to understand that we belonged to the King
    of Spain, who wished to be in peace with him, and wished for nothing
    else than to be able to trade with his island. The king caused an
    answer to be given that he was most pleased that the king of Spain was
    his friend, and that we could take wood and water in his states, and
    traffic according to our pleasure. That done we offered the presents,
    and at each thing which they gave to him, he made a slight inclination
    with his head. To each of us was then given some brocade, with cloth of
    gold, and some silk, which they placed upon one of our shoulders, and
    then took away to take care of them. A collation of cloves and cinnamon
    was then served to us, and after that the curtains were drawn and the
    windows closed. All the men who were in the palace had their middles
    covered with cloth of gold and silk, they carried in their hands
    daggers with gold hilts, adorned with pearls and precious stones, and
    they had many rings on their fingers.</p>

  <p>We again mounted the elephants, and returned to the house of the
    governor. Seven men preceded us there, carrying the presents made to
    us, and when we reached the house they gave to each one of us what
    was for him, putting it on our left shoulder, as had been done in the
    king’s palace. To each of these seven men we gave a pair of knives in
    recompense for their trouble.</p>

  <p>Afterwards there came nine men to the governor’s house, sent by the
    king, with as many large wooden trays, in each of which were ten or
    twelve china dishes, with the flesh of various animals, such as veal,
    capons, fowls, peacocks, and others, with various sorts of fish, so
    that only of flesh there were thirty or thirty-two different viands.
    We supped on the ground on a palm mat; at each mouthful we drank a
    little china cup of the size of an egg full of the distilled liquor of
    rice: we then ate some rice and some things made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>of sugar, using gold
    spoons made like ours. In the place in which we passed the two nights
    there were two candles of white wax always burning, placed on high
    chandeliers of silver, and two oil lamps with four wicks each. Two men
    kept watch there to take care of them. The next morning we came upon
    the same elephants to the sea shore, where there were two prahus ready,
    in which we were taken back to the ships.</p>

  <p>This city is entirely built on foundations in the salt water, except
    the houses of the king and some of the princes: it contains twenty-five
    thousand fires or families.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The houses are all of wood, placed on
    great piles to raise them high up. When the tide rises the women go
    in boats through the city selling provisions and necessaries.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> In
    front of the king’s house there is a wall made of great bricks, with
    barbicans like forts, upon which were fifty-six bombards of metal, and
    six of iron. They fired many shots from them during the two days that
    we passed in the city.</p>

  <p>The king to whom we presented ourselves is a Moor, and is named Raja
    Siripada: he is about forty years of age, and is rather corpulent.
    No one serves him except ladies who are the daughters of the chiefs.
    No one speaks to him except by means of the blow-pipe as has been
    described above. He has ten scribes, who write down his affairs on thin
    bark of trees, and are called <i>chiritoles</i>.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> He never goes out
    of his house except to go hunting.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 29th of July, we saw coming towards us more than
    a hundred prahus, divided into three squadrons, and as many
    <i>tungulis</i>, which are their smaller kind of boats. At this sight,
    and fearing treachery, we hurriedly set sail, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>and left behind an
    anchor in the sea. Our suspicions increased when we observed that
    behind us were certain junks which had come the day before. Our first
    operation was to free ourselves from the junks, against which we fired,
    capturing four and killing many people: three or four other junks went
    aground in escaping. In one of those which we captured was a son of
    the king of the isle of Luzon, who was captain-general of the King of
    Burné, and who was coming with the junks from the conquest of a great
    city named Laoe, situated on a headland of this island opposite Java
    Major. He had made this expedition and sacked that city because its
    inhabitants wished rather to obey the King of Java than the Moorish
    King of Burné. The Moorish king having heard of the ill-treatment by us
    of his junks, hastened to send to say, by means of one of our men who
    was on shore to traffic, that those vessels had not come to do any harm
    to us, but were going to make war against the Gentiles, in proof of
    which they showed us some of the heads of those they had slain.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, we sent to tell the king that if it was so, that he
    should allow two of our men who were still on shore, with a son of our
    pilot, Juan Carvalho, to come to the ships: this son of Carvalho’s had
    been born during his first residence in the country of Brazil: but the
    king would not consent. Juan Carvalho was thus specially punished, for
    without communicating the matter to us, in order to obtain a large sum
    of gold, as we learned later, he had given his liberty to the captain
    of the junks. If he had detained him, the King Siripada would have
    given anything to get him back, that captain being exceedingly dreaded
    by the Gentiles who are most hostile to the Moorish king.</p>

  <p>And, with respect to that, it is well to know and understand that in
    that same port where we were, beyond the city of the Moors of which I
    have spoken, there is another inhabited by Gentiles, larger than this
    one, and also built in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>salt water. So great is the enmity between
    the two nations that every day there occurs strife. The king of the
    Gentiles is as powerful as the king of the Moors, but he is not so
    proud; and it seems that it would not be so difficult to introduce the
    Christian religion into his country.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

  <p>As we could not get back our men, we retained on board sixteen of the
    chiefs, and three ladies whom we had taken on board the junks, to take
    them to Spain. We had destined the ladies for the Queen; but Juan
    Carvalho kept them for himself.</p>

  <p>The Moors of Burné go naked like the other islanders. They esteem
    quicksilver very much, and swallow it. They pretend that it preserves
    the health of those who are well, and that it cures the sick.
    They venerate Mahomed and follow his law. They do not eat pig’s
    flesh....&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> With their right hand they wash their face, but do not
    wash their teeth with their fingers. They are circumcised like the
    Jews. They never kill goats or fowls without first speaking to the
    sun.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> They cut off the ends of the wings of fowls and the skin
    under their feet, and then split them in two. They do not eat any
    animal which has not been killed by themselves.</p>

  <p>In this island is produced camphor, a kind of balsam which exudes from
    between the bark and the wood of the tree. These drops are small as
    grains of bran. If it is left exposed by degrees it is consumed: here
    it is called capor. Here is found also cinnamon, ginger, mirabolans,
    oranges, lemons, sugarcanes, melons, gourds, cucumbers, cabbage,
    onions. There are also many animals, such as elephants, horses,
    buffaloes, pigs, goats, fowls, geese, crows, and others.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

  <p>They say that the King of Burné has two pearls as large as a hen’s
    eggs, and so perfectly round that if placed on a smooth table they
    cannot be made to stand still. When we took him the presents I made
    signs to him that I desired to see them, and he said that he would show
    them to me, but he did not do so. On the following day some of the
    chief men told me that they had indeed seen them.</p>

  <p>The money which the Moors use in this country is of metal,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and
    pierced for stringing together. On one side only it has four signs,
    which are four letters of the great King of China: they call it
    <i>Picis</i>.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> For one cathil (a weight equal to two of our pounds)
    of quicksilver they gave us six porcelain dishes, for a cathil of
    metal they gave one small porcelain vase, and a large vase for three
    knives. For a hand of paper they gave one hundred picis. A <i>bahar</i>
    of wax (which is two hundred and three cathils) for one hundred and
    sixty cathils of bronze: for eighty cathils a bahar of salt: for forty
    cathils a bahar of <i>anime</i>, a gum which they use to caulk ships,
    for in these countries they have no pitch. Twenty tabil make a cathil.
    The merchandise which is most esteemed here is bronze, quicksilver,
    cinnabar, glass, woollen stuffs, linens; but above all they esteem iron
    and spectacles.</p>

  <p>Since I saw such use made of porcelain, I got some information
    respecting it, and I learned that it is made with a kind of very white
    earth, which is left underground for fully fifty years to refine it, so
    that they are in the habit of saying that the father buries it for his
    son. It is said that if poison is put into a vessel of fine porcelain
    it breaks immediately.</p>

  <p>The junks mentioned several times above are their largest vessels,
    and they are constructed in this manner. The lower part of the ships
    and the sides to a height of two spans above <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>water-line are built of
    planks joined together with wooden bolts, and they are well enough
    put together. The upper works are made of very large canes for a
    counterpoise.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> One of these junks carries as much cargo as our
    ships. The masts are of bamboo, and the sails of bark of trees. This
    island is so large that to sail round it with a prahu would require
    three months. It is in 5° 15′ north latitude and 176° 40′ of longitude
    from the line of demarcation.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

  <p>On leaving this island we returned backwards to look for a convenient
    place for caulking our ships, which were leaking, and one of them,
    through the negligence of the pilot, struck on a shoal near an island
    named Bibalon;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> but, by the help of God, we got her off. We also
    ran another great danger, for a sailor, in snuffing a candle, threw the
    lighted wick into a chest of gunpowder; but he was so quick in picking
    it out that the powder did not catch fire.</p>

  <p>On our way we saw four prahus. We took one laden with cocoanuts on its
    way to Burné; but the crew escaped to a small island, and the other
    three prahus escaped behind some other small islands.</p>

  <p>Between the northern cape of Burné and the island named Cimbonbon,
    situated in 8° 7′ N. latitude there is a very convenient port for
    refitting ships, and we entered it; but as we were wanting many things
    necessary for our work, we had to spend there forty-two days. Each one
    worked at one thing or another according to the best of his knowledge
    or ability; but our greatest labour was going to get wood in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>the
    thickets, as the ground was covered with briars and thorny shrubs, and
    we had no shoes.</p>

  <p>In this island there are some very large wild boars. Whilst we were in
    a boat we killed one which was crossing from one island to another.
    Its head was two and a half spans long, and its tusks were exceedingly
    long.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Here also are crocodiles; those of the land are larger than
    those of the sea-coast. There are oysters and very large turtles; of
    these we caught two. The flesh alone of one of them weighed twenty
    pounds, and of the other forty-four pounds. We caught a kind of fish
    with a head like that of a pig, and which had two horns; its body was
    all covered with bone, and on its back it had a kind of saddle: this
    was a small one. In this island are also found certain trees, the
    leaves of which, when they fall, are animated, and walk. They are like
    the leaves of the mulberry tree, but not so long; they have the leaf
    stalk&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> short and pointed, and near the leaf stalk they have on each
    side two feet. If they are touched they escape, but if crushed they
    do not give out blood.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> I kept one for nine days in a box. When I
    opened it the leaf went round the box. I believe they live upon air.
    The island in which we were is called Pulaoan.</p>

  <p>On leaving this island—that is to say, the port which is at the
    extremity of it—we met a junk which was coming from Borneo. We made
    signals to it to strike its sails; but as it would not obey we overtook
    it, captured and pillaged it. It had on board the Governor of Pulaoan,
    with a son and a brother of his. We made them all prisoners, and put
    them to ransom to give within seven days four hundred measures of
    rice, twenty pigs, as many goats, and four hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> and fifty fowls.
    They caused all this to be given us, and besides added spontaneously
    cocoanuts, figs, sugar-canes, and vessels full of palm wine. We, in
    consequence of his generosity, restored to him some of his daggers and
    arquebuses; we also gave him a flag, a garment of yellow damask, and
    fifteen ells of linen. We gave to his son a cloak of blue cloth, and to
    his brother a garment of green cloth, and to the others other things,
    and we parted good friends.</p>

  <p>We turned backwards, passing between the island of Cagayan and the port
    of Cipit,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> taking a course east and a quarter south-east, to seek
    the islands of Maluco. We passed between certain little mountains,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
    around which we found many weeds, although there was there a great
    depth. Passing between these islets it seemed that we were in another
    sea.</p>

  <p>Having left Cipit to the east, we saw to the west two islands called
    Zolo&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and Taghima,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> near which islands pearls are found. The
    two pearls of the King of Burné, of which I have spoken, were found
    there, and this is the manner in which he obtained them, according
    to the account which was given me of it. The King of Burné married a
    daughter of the King of Zolo, who told him that her father had these
    two big pearls. He desired to have them, and decided on getting them by
    any means, and one night he set out with five hundred prahus full of
    armed men, and went to Zolo, and took the king with his two sons, and
    brought them to Burné, and did not restore them to liberty until they
    gave him the two pearls.</p>

  <p>Continuing our course east and a quarter north-east we passed near two
    inhabited places called Cavit and Subanin, and passed near an island
    called Monoripa, ten leagues distant from the before-mentioned islets.
    The inhabitants of this island always live in their vessels, and have
    no houses <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>on shore. In these two districts of Cavit and Subanin, which
    are situated in the same island&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> as that in which are Butuan and
    Calagan, the best cinnamon of any grows. If we could have remained
    here only two days, we could have laden the ships with it; but we did
    not wish to lose time, but to profit by the favourable wind, for we
    had to double a cape and some islets which were around it. Wherefore,
    remaining under sail, we made a little barter, and obtained seventeen
    pounds of cinnamon for two big knives, which we had taken from the
    Governor of Pulaoan.</p>

  <p>Having seen the cinnamon tree, I can give some description of it. It
    is a small tree, not more than three or four cubits high, and of the
    thickness of a man’s finger, and it has not got more than three or four
    little branches. Its leaf is like that of the laurel. The cinnamon for
    use which comes to us, is its bark, which is gathered twice in the
    year. Its wood and leaves when they are green have the taste and force
    of the bark itself. Here it is called Cain-mana, since <i>cain</i>
    means wood and <i>mana</i> sweet.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

  <p>Having set the head of the ship to north-east, we made for a large city
    called Maingdanao, situated in the same island in which are Butuan
    and Calagan, in order to get precise information of the position of
    Maluco. Following this course we took possession of a <i>bignaday</i>,
    a vessel similar to a prahu, and being obliged to have recourse to
    force and violence, we killed seven out of eighteen men who formed the
    crew. These men were better made and more robust than all those we had
    seen hitherto, and they were all chief men of Mindanao. There was among
    them a brother of the king who said that he well knew where Maluco was.
    Afterwards, following his indications, we left the north-east course
    which we held, and took a south-east course. We <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>were then in 6° 7´ N.
    latitude and thirty leagues distant from Cavit.</p>

  <p>We were told that at a cape of this island near to a river there are
    men who are rather hairy, great warriors, and good archers, armed
    with swords a span broad. When they make an enemy prisoner they eat
    his heart only, and they eat it raw with the juice of oranges or
    lemons.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> This cape is called Benaian.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

  <p>Making for the south-east we found four islands, named Ciboco, Birabam
    Batolac, Sarangani, and Candigar. Saturday, the 26th of October, about
    nightfall, whilst coasting the island of Birabam Batolac, we met with
    a very great storm, before which we lowered all our sails, and betook
    ourselves to prayer. Then our three saints appeared upon the masts and
    dispersed the darkness. St. Elmo stood for more than two hours at the
    mainmast head like a flame. St. Nicholas at the head of the foremast,
    and St. Clara on the mizenmast. In gratitude for their assistance we
    promised a slave to each of the saints, and we gave to each an offering.</p>

  <p>Continuing our voyage we entered a port between the two islands
    Sarangani and Candigar, and cast anchor to the east, near a village of
    Sarangani, where pearls and gold are found. This port is in 5° 9´ N.
    latitude, and fifty leagues from Cavit. The inhabitants are Gentiles
    and go naked like the others.</p>

  <p>Having remained here a day we compelled by force two pilots to come
    with us to show us the way to Maluco. We were directed to take a
    south-south-west course, and passed between eight islands partly
    inhabited, partly uninhabited, which formed a kind of street. These
    were named Cheava, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>Caviao, Cabiao Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan,
    and Nuza. At the end of these we reached an island which was very
    beautiful, named Sanghir.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> But having a contrary wind, which did
    not allow us to double the cape, we tacked about backwards and forwards
    near it.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, profiting by the darkness of the night, one of the
    pilots whom we had caught at Sarangani, and with him the brother of the
    king of Mindanao with his little son, escaped by swimming and reached
    that island; but we learned later that the son not being able to hold
    on well to his father’s shoulders, was drowned.</p>

  <p>Seeing that it was impossible to double the head of this island we
    passed below it, where we saw many small islands. This large island
    has four kings whose names are Raja Matandatu, Raja Laga, Raja Bapti,
    and Raja Parabu. These are Gentiles. It is in 3° 30´ N. latitude and
    twenty-seven leagues from Sarangani.</p>

  <p>Continuing our course in the same direction we passed near five islands
    named Cheoma, Carachita, Para, Zangalura, and Cian.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> This last is
    ten leagues distant from Sanghir. In this island there is a rather
    high mountain, but not one of great extent. Its king is named Raja
    Ponto. We came next to the island Paghinzara,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> which has three
    high mountains, and in it the king is Raja Babintan. We saw at twelve
    leagues to the east of Paghinzara another island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
    Talant, and also two islands, not large but inhabited, called Zoar and
    Mean.</p>

    <p>Wednesday, the 6th
    of November, having passed beyond these two islands, we discovered four
    other rather high islands at a distance of fourteen leagues towards the
    east. The pilot who had remained with us told us those were the Maluco
    islands, for which we gave thanks to God, and to comfort ourselves we
    discharged all our artillery. It need not cause wonder that we were so
    much rejoiced, since we had passed twenty-seven months less two days
    always in search of Maluco, wandering for that object among the immense
    number of islands. But I must say that near all these islands the least
    depth that we found was one hundred fathoms, for which reason attention
    is not to be given to all that the Portuguese have spread, according
    to whom the islands of Maluco are situated in seas which cannot be
    navigated on account of the shoals, and the dark and foggy atmosphere.</p>


  <p>Friday, the 8th November of 1521, three hours before sunset, we
    entered a port of the island called Tadore,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and having gone near
    the shore, we cast anchor in twenty fathoms, and discharged all our
    artillery. Next day the king came to the ships in a prahu, and went
    round them. We went to meet him with a boat to show him honour, and
    he made us enter his prahu, and sit near him. He was sitting under a
    silk umbrella, which sheltered him. In front of him was his son with
    the royal sceptre, there were also two men with gold vases to give him
    water for his hands, and two others with gilt caskets full of betel.</p>

  <p>The king gave us a welcome, and said that a long time back he had
    dreamed that some ships were coming to Maluco from distant countries,
    and that to assure himself with respect to this, he had examined the
    moon, and he had seen that they were really coming, and that indeed
    they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>were our ships. After that he came on board our ships, and we all
    kissed his hand: we then conducted him to the poop, but he, in order to
    avoid stooping, would not enter the cabin except by the upper opening.
    We made him sit down on a chair of red velvet, and placed on him a
    Turkish robe of yellow velvet. In order to do him more honour we sat
    down before him on the ground. When he had heard who we were, and what
    was the object of our voyage, he said that he and all his people were
    well content to be the most faithful friends and vassals of the King
    of Spain; that he received us in this island as his own sons; that we
    might go on shore and remain there as in our own houses; and that his
    island for the future should not be named Tadore, but Castile, in proof
    of the great love he bore to the king our master. Then we presented to
    him the chair on which he sat, and the robe which we had put on him, a
    piece of fine linen, four ells of scarlet cloth, a robe of brocade, a
    cloth of yellow damask, a piece of the whitest Cambay linen, two caps,
    six strings of glass beads, twelve knives, three large mirrors, six
    scissors, six combs, some gilt goblets, and other things. We gave to
    his son an Indian cloth of gold and silk, a large mirror, a cap and two
    knives. To each of the nine chief men of his suite we made a present of
    a piece of silk, a cap and two knives; and to many others of his suite
    we made a present, to one of a cap, to another of a knife, until the
    king told us not to give any more presents. He then said that he had
    got nothing worthy to be sent as a present to our king, unless he sent
    himself, now that he considered him as his lord. He invited us to come
    closer to the city, and if any one attempted to come on board the ships
    at night, he told us to fire upon him with our guns. He came out of the
    stern cabin by the same way by which he had entered it, without ever
    bending his head. At his departure we fired all the cannon.</p>

  <p>This king is a Moor, of about forty-five years of age, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>rather well
    made, and of a handsome presence. He is a very great astrologer. His
    dress consisted of a shirt of very fine white stuff, with the ends of
    the sleeves embroidered with gold, and a wrapper which came down from
    his waist almost to the ground. He was barefooted; round his head he
    had a silk veil, and over that a garland of flowers. He is named Raja
    Sultan Manzor.</p>

  <p>On the 10th of November—a Sunday—we had another conversation with
    the king, who wished to know how long a time we had been absent from
    Spain, and what pay and what rations the king gave to each of us; and
    we told him all this. He asked us for a signature of the king and a
    royal standard, since he desired that both his island of Tadore, and
    also that of Tarenate (where he intended to have his nephew named
    Calanogapi, crowned king) should become subject to the King of Spain,
    for whose honour he would fight to the death; and if it should happen
    that he should be compelled to give way, he would take refuge in Spain
    with all his family, in a new junk which he was having constructed, and
    would take with him the royal signature, and standard.</p>

  <p>He begged us to leave with him some of our men, who would always keep
    alive his recollection of us and of our king, as he would more esteem
    having some of us with him than our merchandise, which would not last
    him a long time. Seeing our eagerness to take cloves on board, he said
    that for that purpose he would go to an island called Bachian, where he
    hoped to find as much of them as were wanted, since in his island there
    was not a quantity sufficient of dry cloves to load the two ships. On
    that day there was no traffic because it was Sunday. The holiday of
    these people is on Friday.</p>

  <p>It may please your illustrious lordship to have some description of
    the islands where the cloves grow. They are five—Tarenate, Tador,
    Mutir, Machian, and Bachian. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>Tarenate is the principal island. Its
    king, whilst he lived, had almost entire dominion over the other
    four. Tadore, the island in which we were, has its own king. Mutir
    and Machian have no king, but are governed by the people; and when
    the kings of Tarenate and Tidore are at war, they furnish them with
    combatants. The last is Bachian, and it has a king. All this province
    in which the cloves grow is called Maluco.</p>

  <p>When we arrived here, eight months had not elapsed since a certain
    Portuguese, Francisco Serrano, had died in Tarenate. He was
    captain-general of the King of Tarenate when he was making war on
    the King of Tadore; and he acted so strenuously that this king was
    compelled to give his daughter in marriage to the King of Tarenate,
    who also received as hostages almost all the sons of the chief men of
    Tadore. Peace was then made, and from that daughter was born the nephew
    Calanopagi, of whom I have spoken. But the King of Tadore never forgave
    Serrano in his heart; and he having come several years later to Tadore
    to traffic in cloves, the king had him poisoned with some betel leaves,
    so that he survived hardly four days. The King of Tarenate wished to
    have him buried according to their own usage, but three Christian
    servants that Serrano had with him did not consent to it. In dying he
    left a little son and a little girl that he had of a lady he had taken
    in Java major, and two hundred bahars of cloves.</p>

  <p>Francisco Serrano was a great friend and a relation of our unfortunate
    captain-general, and he it was who induced him to undertake that
    voyage, for when Magellan was at Malacca, he had several times
    learned by letters from Serrano that he was here. Therefore, when D.
    Manuel, King of Portugal, refused to increase his pension by a single
    testoon&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> per month, an increase which he thought he had well
    deserved, he came to Spain and made the proposal to his Sacred Majesty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
    to come here by way of the west, and he obtained all that he asked for.</p>

  <p>Ten days after the death of Serrano, the King of Tarenate, named
    Raja Abuleis,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> drove out from his kingdom his son-in-law the
    King of Bachian, whose wife, the daughter of the King of Tarenate,
    came to Tarenate under the pretext of concluding peace, and gave
    him (her father) such a poison that he only survived two days,
    and dying left nine sons, whose names were told to me as follows:
    Chechili&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi, Chechilideroix, Cilimanzur,
    Cilipagi, Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu, Serich, and Calanopagi.</p>

  <p>Monday, the 11th of November, Chechilideroix, one of the
    above-mentioned sons of the King of Tarenate, came with two prahus to
    the ships sounding drums: he was dressed in red velvet. We learned
    that he had near him the widow and sons of Francisco Serrano. When we
    knew him, being aware that he was an enemy of the King of Tadore, we
    sent to ask him whether we might receive him in the ships, which, as
    we were in his port, we would not do without his consent. The king
    sent us word to do whatever we pleased. But meantime Chechilideroix,
    seeing our hesitation, had some suspicion, and moved further off from
    the ships. We then went to him in a boat, and made him a present of
    an Indian cloth of gold and silk, with some looking-glasses, knives,
    scissors, etc.: these things he accepted but disdainfully, and soon
    after departed. He had with him an Indian who had become a Christian,
    named Manuel, the servant of a certain Pedro Alfonzo de Lorosa, a
    Portuguese, who, after the death of Serrano, had come from Bandan to
    Tarenate. Manuel being able to speak Portuguese, came on board the
    ships, and told us that although the sons of the King of Tarenate were
    enemies to the King of Tadore, yet they were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>disposed towards the
    service of Spain. Then, by means of him, we wrote to De Lorosa to come
    to our ships without any suspicion or fear.</p>

  <p>These kings have as many ladies as they please, but one only is the
    principal wife, and all the others are subject to her. The King of
    Tadore had a large house outside the city, where there were two hundred
    of the ladies he was most fond of, and as many more to serve them. The
    king eats alone, or with his principal wife, on a kind of raised dais,
    from which he can see all the others sitting round, and he decides upon
    the one who most pleases him to come to him. When the king’s dinner is
    finished, the ladies all eat together if he permits it, or else each
    one goes to eat in her own room. No one without special permission from
    the king can see those ladies, and if anybody by day or by night were
    found near their house he would be killed immediately. Each family is
    bound to give one or two daughters to the king. Rajah Sultan Manzour
    had twenty-six children, of whom eight were boys and eighteen girls. In
    the island of Tadore there is a kind of bishop, and the one that was
    there in our time had forty ladies and very many children.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday, the 12th of November, the king had a house built in the
    city for our merchandise, and it was built in one day. Thither we
    carried all that we had to barter, and placed it in the custody of
    three of our men, and the trade began at once. It was carried out in
    this manner. For ten ells of red cloth of pretty good quality they
    gave a bahar of cloves. A bahar is four quintals&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and six pounds.
    For fifteen ells of middling quality a bahar, for fifteen hatchets a
    bahar, for thirty-five glass cups a bahar; and the king in this manner
    had from us almost all our goblets: for seventeen cathils of cinnabar a
    bahar; the same for as much quicksilver. For twenty-six ells of common
    linen a bahar, and the same for twenty-five ells of finer linen; for
    a hundred and fifty knives <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>a bahar; for fifty scissors a bahar; for
    forty caps a bahar; for ten Guzerat cloths a bahar; for three of their
    cymbals two bahars: for a quintal of bronze a bahar. Almost all our
    mirrors were broken, and the few that remained entire the king wished
    to have. Many of the above-mentioned goods had been obtained by us by
    the capture of the junks, which I have related; and the haste we were
    in to return to Spain caused us to sell our goods at a lower price than
    we should have done had we not been in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Every day there came to the ships many boats laden with goats, fowls,
    plantains, cocoanuts, and other victuals, that it was a wonder to see.
    We supplied the ships with good water taken from a spring whence it
    issued hot, but if it remains only one hour in the open air it becomes
    very cold. They say that it comes out like that because it issues from
    the mountain of the cloves. It may be seen from this how those lied
    who said that fresh water had to be brought to Maluco from distant
    countries.</p>

  <p>The next day the king sent his son named Mossahap to the island of the
    Mutir for cloves with which to freight our ships. We had spoken to the
    king that day of some Indians whom we had captured, and he entreated us
    to make a present of them to him, as he had the intention of sending
    them back to their native country, accompanied by five men of Tadore,
    who, on restoring them to their country, would praise and commend the
    King of Spain and make a good name for the Spaniards. We gave him the
    three ladies whom we had destined for the queen, as has been said
    above, and all the men except those of Burné: he very much appreciated
    this gift.</p>

  <p>The king then asked another favour—that was, that we should kill all
    the pigs we had on board, for which he would give an ample compensation
    in fowls and goats. We gave him satisfaction in this, cutting their
    throats and hanging them up under the deck, so that the Moors should
    not have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>occasion to see them, since if by accident they see any pig
    they covered their faces not to see it or perceive its smell.</p>

  <p>In the evening of the same day Pedro Alfonso,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> the Portuguese,
    came in a prahu, but before he came on board the ships the king sent
    to call him, and said to him, that although he belonged to Tarenate he
    should take good care not to answer falsely to the questions we were
    going to ask him. He indeed, after coming on board, told us that he
    had come to India sixteen years ago, and of these years he had passed
    ten in Maluco; and it was just ten years since those islands had been
    discovered by the Portuguese, who kept the discovery secret from us. He
    then related to us that a year, less fifteen days, had elapsed since
    a large ship had come hither proceeding from Malacca, and had gone
    away laden with cloves; but that, on account of the bad weather, she
    had been obliged to remain some months at Bandam. He added that her
    captain was Tristan de Meneses, a Portuguese, from whom, on asking what
    news there was in Europe, he had heard that a squadron of five ships
    had sailed from Seville to discover Maluco in the name of the King of
    Spain, and that the captain of this squadron was Ferdinand Magellan,
    a Portuguese, for which reason the King of Portugal, being angry that
    a subject of his should attempt to do a thing so opposed to him, had
    sent some ships to the cape of Good Hope, and others to the Cape Sta.
    Maria,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> where the cannibals are, to impede their passage, but they
    had not fallen in with them. Having learned later that Magellan had
    passed by another sea, and was making for Maluco by way of the west, he
    had written to his Captain-Major of the Indies, named Diogo Lopez de
    Sequeira, to send six ships to Maluco against the Spanish squadron. But
    the captain-major, having at that time received information that the
    Grand Turk was planning an expedition against Malacca, was obliged to
    send against <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>him sixty sail to the Straits of Mekkah, in the country
    of Jiddah, where, however, they only found a few galleys which had
    grounded near the beautiful and strong city of Aden, and they set fire
    to them.</p>

  <p>This enterprise, added De Lorosa, had prevented the captain-major
    from immediately sending an expedition against Magellan; but a little
    later he had sent to Maluco a great galloon with two rows of cannon,
    commanded by Francisco Faria, a Portuguese: but neither did this one
    come, for on account of the shoals and currents which are near Malacca,
    and the contrary winds, it was unable to pass that promontory, and was
    compelled to turn back.</p>

  <p>He also related that a few days before a caravel with two junks had
    come to these parts to get news of us. The junks had sailed to Bachian
    to load cloves, with seven Portuguese on board. These men, who did
    not respect the wives of the inhabitants, nor even those of the king,
    notwithstanding the warning they had received from the king himself,
    were all killed. The men of the caravel, on hearing of this, returned
    in haste to Malacca, abandoning the junks with four hundred bahars of
    cloves and as much merchandise as would have purchased another hundred
    bahars. He also related that every year many junks go from Malacca to
    Bandan to buy mace and nutmeg, and go thence to Maluco to purchase
    cloves. They make the voyage from Bandan to Maluco in three days, and
    employ fifteen in the voyage from Bandan to Malacca. He said, lastly,
    that since ten years back the King of Portugal had derived great profit
    from these islands, and he took especial care to keep these countries
    concealed from and unknown to the Spaniards. He related many other
    similar things, passing several hours in conversation with us: and we
    said and did so much, offering him a large salary, that we made him
    determine on coming with us to Spain.</p>

  <p>Friday, the 15th of November, the king told us that he thought of going
    himself to Bachian to get the cloves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>which the Portuguese had left
    there, and asked us for presents to give to the two governors of Mutir
    in the name of the King of Spain. Meanwhile, having come close to our
    ships, he wished to see how we shot with the cross-bow, with guns,
    and with a swivel gun, which is a weapon larger than an arquebuse. He
    himself fired three times with a cross-bow, but he did not care to fire
    with a gun.</p>

  <p>Opposite Tadore there is another very large island, called
    Giailolo&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>, and it is so large that a prahu can with difficulty go
    round it in four months. It is inhabited by Moors and Gentiles. The
    Moors have two kings, one of whom, according to what the King of Tadore
    related to us, has had six hundred children, and the other has had
    five hundred and twenty-five. The Gentiles have not got so many women
    as the Moors, and are less superstitious. The first thing they meet
    in the morning when they go out of their houses is the object which
    they worship throughout that day. The king of these Gentiles is named
    Rajah Papua. He is very rich in gold, and inhabits the interior of the
    island. There grow here among the rocks bamboos as thick as a man’s
    leg, full of water, which is very good to drink. We purchased many of
    them.</p>

  <p>On Saturday the Moorish King of Giailolo came to the ships with many
    prahus, and we made him a present of a green damask robe, two ells of
    red cloth, some looking-glasses, scissors, knives, combs, and two gilt
    goblets, which things pleased him very much, and he said to us that, as
    we were friends of the King of Tadore, we were also his friends, since
    he loved that king like one of his own sons. He invited us to come to
    his country, promising to do us great honour. This king is powerful,
    and held in sufficient respect throughout all these islands. He is very
    old, and his name is Raja Jussu.</p>

  <p>Sunday morning this same king came on board the ships <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>and wished to
    see how we fought, and how we discharged the bombards, at which he was
    greatly pleased, for in his youth he had been a great warrior.</p>

  <p>The same day I went on shore to see how the cloves grow, and this is
    what I observed. The tree from which they are gathered is high, and its
    trunk is as thick as a man’s body, more or less, according to the age
    of the plant. Its branches spread out somewhat in the middle of the
    tree, but near the top they form a pyramid. The bark is of an olive
    colour, and the leaves very like those of the laurel. The cloves grow
    at the end of little branches in bunches of ten or twenty. These trees
    always bear more fruit on one side than on the other, according to the
    seasons. The cloves are white when they first sprout, they get red as
    they ripen, and blacken when dry. They are gathered twice in the year,
    once about Christmas and the other time about St. John’s day, when the
    air in these countries is milder, and it is still more so in December.
    When the year is rather hot, and there is little rain, they gather in
    each of these islands from three to four hundred bahars of cloves.
    The clove tree does not live except in the mountains, and if it is
    transferred to the plain it dies there.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The leaf, the bark, and
    the wood, as long as they are green, have the strength and fragrance of
    the fruit itself. If these are not gathered when just ripe they get so
    large and hard that nothing of them remains good except the rind. It is
    said that the mist renders them perfect, and indeed we saw almost every
    day a mist descend and surround one or other of the above-mentioned
    mountains. Among these people everyone possesses some of these trees,
    and each man watches over his own trees and gathers their fruit, but
    does not do any work round them to cultivate them. This tree does not
    grow except in the five mountains of the five Maluco islands. There
    are, however, a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>few trees in Giailolo and in a small island between
    Tadore and Mutir named Mare, but they are not good.</p>

  <p>There are in this island of Giailolo some trees of nutmegs. These are
    like our walnuts, and the leaves also are similar. The nutmeg, when
    gathered, is like the quince in form and colour, and the down which
    covers it, but it is smaller. The outside rind is as thick as the green
    rind of our walnuts, beneath which is a thin web, or rather cartilage,
    under which is the mace, of a very bright red, which covers and
    surrounds the rind of the nuts, inside which is the nutmeg properly so
    called.</p>

  <p>There also grows in Tadore the ginger, which we used to eat green;
    instead of bread. Ginger is not a tree, but a shrub, which sends out
    of the earth shoots a span long like the shoots of canes, which they
    also resemble in the shape of the leaves, only those of the ginger are
    narrower. The shoots are good for nothing; that which makes ginger is
    the root. When green, it is not so strong as when it is dry, and to dry
    it they use lime, or else it would not keep.</p>

  <p>The houses of these people are built like those already described,
    but are not so high above the ground, and are surrounded with canes
    after the fashion of a hedge. The women here are ugly, and go naked
    like the others, having only their middles covered with cloth made of
    bark. The men also are naked, and notwithstanding that their women are
    ugly, they are exceedingly jealous; and amongst other things which
    displeased them, was that we came ashore without cloaks,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> because
    they imagined that might cause temptation to their wives. Both men and
    women always go barefoot.</p>

  <p>Since I have spoken of cloth, I will relate how they make it. They take
    a piece of bark and leave it in water until it has grown soft; they
    then beat it with wooden clubs to extend it in length and breadth, as
    much as they please; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>thus it becomes like a veil of raw silk with
    filaments enlaced within it, so that it appears as if it was woven.</p>

  <p>Their bread is made with the wood of a tree like a palm tree, and
    they make it in this way. They take a piece of this wood, and extract
    from it certain long black thorns&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> which are situated there; then
    they pound it, and make bread of it which they call sagu. They make
    provisions of this bread for their sea voyages.</p>

  <p>Every day there came from Tarenate many boats laden with cloves, but
    we, because we were waiting for the king, would not traffic for those
    goods, but only for victuals: and the men of Tarenate complained much
    of this.</p>

  <p>On Sunday night, the 24th of November, the king arrived, and on
    entering the port had his drums sounded, and passed between our ships.
    We fired many bombards to do him honour. He told us that for four days
    we should be continually supplied with cloves.</p>

  <p>In effect, on Monday he sent seven hundred and ninety one catils,
    without taking tare. To take tare means to take spice for less than
    what it weighs, and the reason of this is because when they are fresh,
    every day they diminish in weight. As these were the first cloves
    which we took on board, and the principal object of our voyage, we
    fired our bombards for joy. Cloves are called <i>Gomode</i> in this
    place; in Sarangani where we took the two pilots they are called
    <i>Bonglavan</i>, and in Malacca <i>Chianche</i>.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

  <p>Tuesday the 26th November the King came to tell us that for us he had
    done what a King never does here, that was to leave his own island; but
    he had gone to show the affection he had for the King of Castile, and
    because when we had got our cargo, we could sooner return to Spain,
    and afterwards return with greater forces to avenge the death <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>of his
    father, who had been killed in an island called Buru, and his body had
    been thrown into the sea.</p>

  <p>He afterwards added that it was the custom in Tadore, when the first
    cloves were embarked in a vessel, or in junks, that the king gave a
    feast to their crews and merchants, and they made prayers to God to
    bring them in safety to their port. He wished to do the same for us,
    and at the same time the feast would serve for the King of Bachian,
    who was coming with a brother of his to pay him a visit, and on that
    account he had the streets cleaned. Hearing this, some of us began
    to suspect some treachery; all the more because we learned that, not
    long before, three Portuguese of the companions of Francisco Serrano
    had been assassinated at the place where we got water, by some of the
    islanders concealed in the thickets; also we often saw them whispering
    with the Indians whom we had made prisoners. Therefore, although some
    of us were inclined to accept the invitation, we concluded not to
    betake ourselves thither, recollecting the unfortunate feast given to
    our men in the island of Zubu, and we decided on a speedy departure.</p>

  <p>Meantime a message was sent to the king to thank him, and to ask him
    to come soon to the ships, where we would deliver to him the four men
    we had promised him, with the goods which we had destined for him. The
    King came soon, and on entering the ship, as though he had observed
    that we had doubts, said that he entered with as much confidence
    and security as into his own house. He made us feel how much he was
    displeased by our unexpected haste to depart, since ships used to
    employ thirty days in taking in their cargo; and that if he had made
    a journey out of the island, he certainly had not done it to injure
    us but to assist us, so that we might more speedily obtain the cloves
    which we required, and a part of which we were still expecting. He
    added that it was not then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>a fit season for navigating in those seas,
    on account of the many shoals near Bandan, and besides it would be a
    likely thing that we should fall in with some Portuguese ships. When,
    in spite of what he had said, he saw we were still determined on
    going away, he said that we must take back all that we had given him,
    since the Kings, his neighbours, would consider him as a man without
    reputation for receiving so many presents in the name of so great a
    king as the King of Spain, and he had given nothing in return, and
    perhaps they would suspect that the Spaniards had gone away in such
    haste for fear of some treachery, so that they would fix upon him the
    name of traitor. Then, in order that no suspicion might remain in
    our minds of his honesty and good faith, he ordered his Koran to be
    brought, and kissing it devoutly he placed it four or five times on
    his head whilst whispering certain words to himself, with a rite which
    they call Zambehan,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and he said in the presence of us all, that
    he swore by Allah and by the Koran, which he held in his hand, that
    he would ever be faithful and a friend to the King of Spain. He said
    all this almost weeping and with so great an appearance of sincerity
    and cordiality, that we promised to prolong our sojourn at Tadore for
    another fortnight. We then gave him the Royal signature and standard.
    We learned later, by a sure and certain channel, that some of the
    chiefs of those islands had indeed counselled him to kill all of us,
    by which thing he would have acquired for himself great merit with the
    Portuguese, who would have given him good assistance to avenge himself
    on the King of Bachian, but he, loyal and constant to the King of
    Spain, with whom he had sworn a peace, had answered that he would never
    do such an act on any account whatever.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, the 27th November, the king issued a proclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> that
    whoever had cloves might freely sell them to us. For which reason all
    that and the following day, we bought cloves like mad.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

  <p>Friday, in the afternoon, the governor of Machian came with many
    prahus, but he would not come on shore, because his father and his
    brother, who had been banished from Machian, had taken refuge here.</p>

  <p>The following day the King of Tadore, with his nephew, the governor,
    named Humai, a man of twenty-five years of age, came on board the
    ships, and the king, on hearing that we had no more cloth, sent to
    fetch from his house six ells of red cloth, and gave them to us in
    order that we might, by adding other objects, make a fitting present to
    the governor. We made him the present, and he thanked us much, and said
    that soon he would send us plenty of cloves. At his departure from the
    ship we fired several bombards.</p>

  <p>Sunday the 1st day of December, the above-mentioned governor departed
    from Tadore; and we were told that the king had made him a present of
    some silk cloths and drums, for him to send us the cloves sooner. On
    Monday, the king himself went again out of the island for the same
    object. Wednesday morning, as it was the day of St. Barbara,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and
    on account of the King’s arrival all the artillery was discharged. The
    king came to the beach to see how we fired rockets and fire balls, and
    took great pleasure in them.</p>

  <p>Thursday and Friday we purchased a good many cloves both in the city
    and at the ships at a much lower price, as the time of our departure
    grew nearer. For four ells of riband&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> they gave a bahar of cloves,
    for two little chains of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>brass which were worth a marcello,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> they
    gave us a hundred pounds; and at last each man being desirous of having
    his portion of the cargo, and as there were no more goods to give in
    exchange for cloves, one gave his cloak, another his coat, and another
    a shirt or other clothes to obtain them.</p>

  <p>On Saturday three sons of the King of Tarenate, with their wives, who
    were daughters of our King of Tadore, and afterwards Pedro Alfonso,
    the Portuguese, came to the ships. We gave a gilt glass goblet to each
    of the brothers, and to the three wives scissors and other things;
    and when they went away we fired several bombards in their honour. We
    afterwards sent on shore a present of several things to the widow of
    the King of Tarenate, daughter of the King Tadore, who had not ventured
    to come on board the ships.</p>

  <p>Sunday the 8th December, we fired many bombards, rockets, and fireballs
    to celebrate the Conception of our Lady. Monday in the afternoon, the
    King came to the ships with three women who carried his betel. It is to
    be observed that no one can take women about with him except the king.
    Afterwards the King of Giailolo came to see again our gun exercise.</p>

  <p>Some days later, as the day of our departure grew near, the king showed
    us a sincere affection, and among other obliging things, said to us
    that it seemed to him that he was a sucking child whom its mother was
    about to leave, and that he remained disconsolate all the more now that
    he had become acquainted with us and liked several things of Spain, for
    which reason he entreated us not to delay our return thence to Tadore.
    Meantime, he begged us to leave <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>him some of our swivel guns&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> for
    his own defence. He warned us at the same time not to navigate except
    by daylight, on account of the shoals and reefs which exist in these
    seas; but we answered him that because of our need to arrive in Spain
    as soon as possible, we were obliged to navigate night and day: he then
    added that, being unable to do anything else, he would pray God every
    day to bring us home in safety.</p>

  <p>During this time Pedro Alfonso de Lorosa had come to the ships with his
    wife and property to return with us. Two days after, Kechilideroix,
    son of the King of Tarenate, came with a prahu well filled with men,
    and approaching the ships requested Lorosa to come into his prahu;
    but Lorosa, who suspected him, refused to do so, and told him he had
    determined on going away with those ships to Spain. For the same
    suspicion he advised us not to receive him in the ships; and we did
    not choose that he should come on board when he asked to do so. It was
    known later that Kechili was a great friend of the Portuguese captain
    of Malacca, and had the intention of seizing Lorosa and of conducting
    him thither; and on that account he severely reprimanded those persons
    with whom this Portuguese lived, for having let him depart without his
    permission.</p>

  <p>The king had informed us that the King of Bachian would soon arrive,
    with a brother of his who was going to marry one of his daughters, and
    had asked us to do him honour by firing bombards on his arrival. He
    arrived on Sunday the 15th of December, in the afternoon, and we did
    him honour as the king had desired; we did not, however, discharge the
    heavier cannon, as we were heavily laden. The king and his brother
    came in a prahu with three banks of rowers on each side, a hundred
    and twenty in number. The prahu was adorned with many streamers made
    of white, yellow and red parrot’s feathers. They were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>sounding many
    cymbals, and that sound served to give the measure to the rowers
    to keep time. In two other prahus were the damsels who were to be
    presented to the bride. They returned us the salute by going round the
    ships and round the port.</p>

  <p>As it is the custom that no king disembarks on the land of another
    king, the King of Tadore came to visit him of Bachian in his own prahu:
    this one, seeing the other coming, rose from the carpet on which he
    was sitting, and placed himself on one side to make way for the king
    of the country: but he, out of ceremony, would not sit on the carpet,
    but sat on the other side of it, leaving the carpet between them. Then
    the King of Bachian gave to him of Tadore five hundred <i>patol</i>, as
    if in payment of the daughter he was giving as a wife to his brother.
    <i>Patols</i> are cloths of gold and silk worked in China, and are very
    much prized in these islands. Each of these cloths is paid for with
    three bahars of cloves more or less, according as they are more or less
    rich in gold and embroidery. Whenever one of the chief men die, his
    relations put on these cloths to do him honour.</p>

  <p>Monday, the King of Tadore sent a dinner to the king of Bachian,
    carried by fifty women clothed with silk from their waists to their
    knees. They went two and two with a man between in the midst of them.
    Each one carried a large dish upon which were small dishes with various
    viands; ten of the oldest of these women were the mace-bearers. They
    proceeded in this way to the prahu, and presented everything to the
    king who was sitting on a carpet under a red and yellow canopy. As
    they were returning, they caught some of our men who had come out of
    curiosity and who were obliged to make them presents of some trifle
    to get free. After that the king sent also to us a present of goats,
    cocoanuts, wine, and other things.</p>

  <p>This day we bent on the ships new sails, upon which was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>the cross of
    St. James, of Gallicia, with letters which said: “This is the figure of
    our good fortune.”</p>

  <p>Tuesday, we presented to the king some pieces of artillery; that is
    some arquebuses which we had taken as prizes in the Indies, and some of
    our swivel-guns with four barrels of powder. We took on board each ship
    eighty barrels of water. Wood we were to find at the island of Mare,
    where the king had already five days ago sent a hundred men to prepare
    it, and near which we were to pass.</p>

  <p>This day, the King of Bachian, with the consent of the King of Tadore,
    came on shore, preceded by four men holding up daggers in their hands,
    to make alliance with us: he said, in the presence of the King of
    Tadore and of all his suite, that he would always be ready for the
    service of the King of Spain, that he would keep in his name the cloves
    left in his island by the Portuguese, until another Spanish squadron
    arrived there, and he would not give them up without his consent. He
    sent through us to the King of Spain a present of a slave and two
    bahars of cloves. He would have wished to have sent ten bahars, but our
    ships were so heavily laden, that we could not receive any more.</p>

  <p>He also gave us for the King of Spain two most beautiful dead birds.
    These birds are as large as thrushes; they have small heads, long
    beaks, legs slender like a writing pen, and a span in length; they have
    no wings, but instead of them long feathers of different colours, like
    plumes: their tail is like that of the thrush. All the feathers, except
    those of the wings, are of a dark colour; they never fly, except when
    the wind blows. They told us that these birds come from the terrestrial
    Paradise, and they call them “bolon dinata” that is divine birds.</p>

  <p>The King of Bachian was a man of about seventy years of age. Not only
    did the King of Bachian recognise the King of Spain as his Sovereign;
    but every king of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>Maluco wrote to him that he desired always to be his
    faithful subject.</p>

  <p>One day the King of Tadore sent to tell our men, who dwelt in the
    magazine for the merchandise, that they should take care not to go out
    of the house by night, since there were certain men, natives of the
    country, who by anointing themselves, walk by night in the shape of
    men without heads: and if they meet anyone to whom they wish ill, they
    touch his hand and anoint his palm, and that ointment causes him soon
    to grow ill, and die at the end of three or four days. But if they meet
    three or four persons together they do not touch them, but make them
    giddy. He added that he had a watch kept to discover them, and he had
    already had several executed.</p>

  <p>When they build a new house, before going to inhabit it, they make a
    fire round it, and give many feasts there. Then they fasten to the roof
    of the house a pattern or sample of everything that is to be found in
    the island, persuaded that by that means none of those things will be
    ever wanting to whoever inhabits the house.</p>

  <p>Wednesday morning everything was prepared for our departure from
    Maluco. The Kings of Tadore, of Giailolo, and of Bachian, and a son of
    the King of Tarenate had come to accompany us as far as the island of
    Mare. The ship “Victoria” made sail and stood out a little, waiting
    for the ship “Trinity”; but she had much difficulty in getting up the
    anchor, and meanwhile the sailors perceived that she was leaking very
    much in the hold. Then the “Victoria” returned to anchor in her former
    position. They began to discharge the cargo of the “Trinity” to see if
    the leak could be stopped, for it was perceived that the water came in
    with force as through a pipe, but we were never able to find out at
    what part it came in. All that day and the next we did nothing else
    but work at the pumps, but without any advantage.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>Hearing this, the
    King of Tadore came at once to the ships, and occupied himself with us
    in searching for the leak. For this purpose he sent into the sea five
    of his men, who were accustomed to remain a long time under the water,
    and although they remained more than half-an-hour they could not find
    the fissure. As the water inside the ship continually increased, the
    king, who was as much affected by it as we were, and lamenting this
    misfortune, sent to the end of the island for three other men, more
    skilful than the first at remaining under water.</p>

  <p>He came with them early the next morning. These men dived under water
    with their hair loose, thinking that their hair, attracted by the
    water which penetrated into the ship, would indicate to them the leak,
    but though they remained more than an hour in the water, they did not
    find it. The king, seeing that there was no remedy for it, said with
    lamentation, “Who will go to Spain to take news of me to the king our
    lord?” We answered him that the “Victoria” would go there, and would
    sail at once to take advantage of the east winds, which had already
    commenced. The “Trinity,” meanwhile, would be refitted and would wait
    for the west winds and go to Darien, which is on the other side of the
    sea, in the country of Diucatan.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The king approved our thoughts,
    and said that he had in his service two hundred and twenty-five
    carpenters who would do all the work under the direction of our men,
    and that those who should remain there would be treated as his own
    children, and he said this with so much emotion that he moved us all to
    tears.</p>

  <p>We, who were on board the “Victoria,” fearing that she might open,
    on account of the heavy cargo and the long voyage, lightened her by
    discharging sixty hundred weight of cloves, which we had carried to
    the house where the crew of the “Trinity” were lodged. Some of our own
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>crew preferred to remain at Maluco rather than go with us to Spain,
    because they feared that the ship could not endure so long a voyage,
    and because, mindful of how much they had suffered, they feared to die
    of hunger in mid-ocean.</p>

  <p>Saturday, the 21st December, day of St. Thomas the Apostle, the King
    of Tadore came to the ships and brought us the two pilots, whom we had
    already paid, to conduct us out of these islands. They said that the
    weather was then good for sailing at once, but, having to wait for the
    letters of our companions who remained behind, and who wished to write
    to Spain, we could not sail till midday. Then the ships took leave of
    one another by a mutual discharge of bombards. Our men accompanied us
    for some distance with their boat, and then with tears and embraces we
    separated. Juan Carvalho remained at Tadore with fifty-three of our
    men: we were forty-seven Europeans and thirteen Indians.</p>

  <p>The king’s governor&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> came with us as far as the island of Mare:
    we had hardly arrived there when four prahus laden with wood came up,
    which in less than an hour we got on board. We then took the south-west
    course.</p>

  <p>In all the above-mentioned islands of Maluco are to be found cloves,
    ginger, sagu, which is their bread made of wood, rice, cocoa-nuts,
    plantains, almonds larger than ours, sweet and bitter pomegranates,
    sugar-canes, oil of cocoa and of sesame, melons, cucumbers, pumpkins,
    comilicai,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> which is a refreshing fruit the size of a water-melon,
    another fruit like a peach called guave, and other eatable vegetables.
    They also have goats and fowls, honey produced by bees not larger than
    ants, which make their hives in trunks of trees. There are also parrots
    of many kinds, and amongst them there are white ones called Catara, and
    red ones called <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>Nori, which are the most sought after, not so much for
    the beauty of their plumage, as because they talk more clearly. One of
    these is sold for a bahar of cloves.</p>

  <p>It is hardly fifty years since the Moors conquered Maluco and dwelt
    there. Before that, these islands were inhabited only by Gentiles, who
    did not care for the cloves. There are still some families of them who
    have taken refuge in the mountains, where the cloves grow.</p>

  <p>The island of Tadore is in 0 deg. 27 min. North latitude, and 161 deg.
    west of the line of demarcation;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> it is 9 deg. 30 min. distant from
    the first island of this archipelago, named Zamal, to the south-east
    and a quarter south. The island of Tarenate is in 0 deg. 40 min. of N.
    latitude. Mutir is exactly under the equinoctial line. Machian is in 0
    deg. 15 min. S. latitude, and Bachian in 1 deg. of the same latitude.
    Tarenate, Tadore, Mutir, and Machian, are like four high and pointed
    mountains,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> upon which the clove trees grow. Bachian is not visible
    from these four islands, but it is a larger island than any of those.
    Its clove mountain is not so high nor so pointed as those of the other
    islands, but it has a larger base.</p>

  <h4 class="smcap">Return from the Moluccas to Spain.</h4>

  <p>Pursuing our voyage, after having taken in wood at the islet of Mare,
    we passed between the following islands:—Caioan, Laigoma, Sico, Giogi,
    Cafi, Laboan,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Toliman, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>Titameti, Bachian, Latalata, Jabobi, Mata,
    and Batutiga. They told us that in the island of Cafi the people were
    small and dwarfed like the Pigmies; they have been subjected by force
    by the King of Tadore. We passed outside of Batutiga to the west, and
    we steered between west and south-west, and we discovered some islets
    to the south, on which account the pilots of Maluco said it would be
    better to cast anchor so as not to drift at night among many islets and
    shoals. We, therefore, altered our course to south-east, and went to
    an island situated in 2 deg. S. latitude, and fifty-three leagues from
    Maluco.</p>

  <p>This island is named Sulach;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> its inhabitants are Gentiles, and
    have not got a king. They eat human flesh; both men and women go naked,
    except a piece of the bark of a tree of two fingers’ breadth before
    their natural parts. There are many other islands around here inhabited
    by anthropophagi. These are the names of some of them:—Silan, Noselao,
    Biga, Atulabaon, Leitimor, Tenetum, Gonda, Kailaruru, Mandan and
    Benaia.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> We left to the east the islands named Lamatola and Tenetum.</p>

  <p>Having run ten leagues from Sulach in the same direction, we went to a
    rather large island named Buru, in which we found plenty of victuals,
    such as pigs, goats, fowls, sugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, sagu, a certain
    food of theirs made of bananas called kanali, and chiacare, which here
    they call Nanga.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The chiacare are fruit like water-melons, but
    knotty on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>the outside; inside they have some small red fruit like
    plums, they have not got a stone in the middle, but instead of that
    have a certain pith like a white bean, but larger, they are tender to
    eat like chestnuts. We found here another fruit which externally is
    like a pine cone, and it is yellow, but white inside; on cutting, it is
    something like a pear, but much softer and better tasted. Here it is
    called comilicai. The inhabitants of this island are Gentiles, and have
    no king: they go naked like those of Sulach. The island of Buru is in 3
    deg. 30 min. S. latitude, and seventy-five leagues from Maluco.</p>

  <p>To the east of this island, at a distance of ten leagues, there is
    another one larger, and which borders on Giailolo, and it is named
    Ambon.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> It is inhabited by Moors and Gentiles, but the former
    are on the sea shore, and the others in the interior; these are also
    anthropophagi. The products of this island are the same as those of
    Buru. Between Buru and Ambon, there are three islands surrounded by
    reefs named Vudia, Kailaruru and Benaia. To the south of Buru, at a
    distance of four leagues, is another small island named Ambalao.</p>

  <p>At thirty-five leagues from Buru, south and a quarter south-west, is
    Bandon, with thirteen other islands. In six of them grow mace and
    nutmeg. Zoroboa is the largest of them, Chelicel, Saniananpi, Pulai,
    Puluru, and Rasoghin, the other six are Unuveru, Pulanbaracan, Lailaca,
    Mamica, Man, and Meut. In these islands nutmegs are not found, but only
    sagu, rice, cocoanuts, bananas, and other fruits, and they are near one
    another. The inhabitants of these are Moors, and have no king. Bandan
    is in 6 deg. of S. latitude, and 163 deg. 30 min. longitude from the
    line of demarcation. As this island was a little out of our course, we
    did not go to it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

  <p>Leaving the island of Buru in the direction south-west and a quarter
    west, about eight degrees of latitude,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> we arrived at three other
    islands near each other named Zolot,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Nocemamor, and Galian. Whilst
    we sailed amidst these islands, a great storm fell upon us, for which
    we made a vow of a pilgrimage to our Lady della Guida. We put the ship
    before the storm and made for a rather high island, which afterwards
    we learned was named Mallua, but before we could reach it, we had
    to struggle much with the squalls of wind which descended from the
    mountains and with the currents. The inhabitants of this island are
    savages, and more beasts than men; they eat human flesh; they go naked,
    except the usual piece of bark to cover their natural parts. But when
    they go to fight they wear on the back, the breast, and the flanks,
    pieces of buffalo hide, ornamented with shells,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and boars’ tusks,
    and tails of goat skins, hanging before and behind. They wear the hair
    raised high up by means of cane combs with long teeth, which go through
    it. They wrap up their beards with leaves, and enclose them in cases or
    tubes of reed, a thing which seemed to us very ridiculous. In one word
    these were the ugliest men we had seen in these Indies. Both their bows
    and arrows are made of reeds, and they carry their food in bags made of
    leaves. When their women saw us they came towards us with their bows
    drawn, but when we had given them some presents we soon became friends.</p>

  <p>We passed fifteen days in this island in caulking the ship whose sides
    had suffered. We found here goats, fowls, wax, cocoanuts, and pepper.
    For a pound of old iron they gave fifteen pounds of wax or of pepper.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of pepper here, the long and the round. The long
    pepper is like the flower of the hazel tree <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>in winter; its plant is
    like ivy, and like it clings to trees; its leaves are like those of
    the mulberry tree; it is called luli. The round pepper grows like the
    other, but its fruit is in ears like Indian corn, and the grains are
    pulled off in the same manner; it is called lada. The fields here are
    full of pepper plants.</p>

  <p>Here we took a man to conduct us to some island where we could find
    plenty of victuals.</p>

  <p>The island of Mallua is in 8 deg. 30 min. S. latitude, and 169 deg. 40
    min. longitude from the line of demarcation.</p>

  <p>The old pilot from Maluco related to us, whilst sailing, that in this
    neighbourhood there was an island named Aruchete, the inhabitants
    of which, men and women, are not more than one cubit high, and they
    have ears as large and as long as themselves, so that when they lie
    down one serves them for a mattress, and with the other they cover
    themselves.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> They are shorn and naked, their voices are shrill,
    and they run very swiftly. They dwell under ground, live on fish and
    a certain substance which grows between the bark and the wood of a
    tree, which is white and round like coriander comfits, and which is
    named ambulon. We would have gone there willingly, but the shoals and
    currents did not allow of it.</p>

  <p>Saturday the 25th of January, (1522), at 22 o’clock,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> we left the
    island of Mallua; and the following day, having run five leagues to
    the south-south-east, we arrived at a large island called Timor. I
    went ashore alone to speak to the head man of a village named Amaban,
    about his providing us with victuals. He offered me buffaloes, pigs,
    and goats, but when it was a question of the goods which he wanted in
    exchange, we could not come to an agreement, because he asked a great
    deal, and we had got very little to give. Then as we were constrained
    by hunger, we took the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>measure of detaining on board the ship the
    chief of another village named Balibo, who had come there in good faith
    with a son of his; and we imposed upon him as a ransom for recovering
    his liberty, to give six buffaloes, ten pigs, and ten goats. He, being
    much afraid that we should kill him, quickly gave orders to have all
    this brought to us; and as there were only five goats and two pigs,
    they gave us instead an additional buffalo. We then sent him ashore
    with his son, and he was well pleased when we not only left him free,
    but also gave him some linen, some Indian cloths of silk and cotton,
    some hatchets, some Indian knives, scissors, looking-glasses, and some
    of our knives.</p>

  <p>The chief man, whom I went to speak to first, has only women in his
    service; all were naked like those of the neighbouring islands, and
    wear in their ears small gold rings with tufts of silk hanging from
    them; on their arms they wear many rings of gold and copper, which
    often cover them up to the elbow. The men are naked like the women, and
    wear attached to their necks round plates of gold, and on their heads
    reed combs ornamented with gold rings. Some of them, instead of gold
    rings, wore in their ears dried necks of gourds.</p>

  <p>In this island there are buffaloes, pigs, and goats, as has been said;
    there are also fowls and parrots of various colours. There is also
    rice, bananas, ginger, sugar canes, oranges, lemons, beans and almonds.</p>

  <p>We had approached that part of the island where there were some
    villages with their chiefs or head men. On the other side of the island
    are the dwellings of four kings, and their districts are named Oibich,
    Lichsana, Suai, and Cabanaza. Oibich is the largest place. We were told
    that in a mountain near Cabanaza, very much gold is found, and its
    inhabitants buy whatever they want with small pieces of gold. All the
    trade in sandal wood and wax, carried on by the people of Malacca and
    Java, is done here; and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>indeed, we found here a junk which had come
    from Lozon&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> to trade in sandal wood; for white sandal wood only
    grows in this country.</p>

  <p>These people are Gentiles; we were told that when they go to cut sandal
    wood, the devil appears to them in various forms, and tells them that
    if they want anything they should ask him for it; but this apparition
    frightens them so much, that they are ill of it for some days.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The
    sandal wood is cut at a certain phase of the moon, and it is asserted
    that if cut at another time it would not be good. The merchandise
    most fitting for bartering here for sandal wood is red cloth, linen,
    hatchets, iron, and nails.</p>

  <p>This island is entirely inhabited. It extends a long way from east to
    west, and little from north to south. Its south latitude is in 10 deg.,
    and the longitude 174 deg. 30 min. from the line of demarcation.</p>

  <p>In all these islands that we visited in this archipelago, the evil of
    Saint Job prevailed, and more here than in any other place, where they
    call it “for franki”, that is to say, Portuguese illness.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

  <p>We were told that at a day’s voyage, west-north-west from Timor, there
    was an island in which much cinnamon grows, called Ende;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> its
    inhabitants are Gentiles, and have no king. Near this are many others
    forming a series of islands as far as Java Major, and the Cape of
    Malacca. The names of these islands are Ende, Tanabuton, Crenochile,
    Bimacore, Azanaran, Main, Zubava, Lombok, Chorum, and Java Major, which
    by the inhabitants is not called Java but Jaoa.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

  <p>In this island of Java are the largest towns; the principal of them
    is Magepaher,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> the king of which, when he lived, was the greatest
    of all the kings of the neighbouring islands, and he was named Raja
    Patiunus Sunda. Much pepper grows there. The other towns are—Dahadama,
    Gagiamada, Minutarangam, Ciparafidain, Tuban, Cressi,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and
    Cirubaya.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> At half a league from Java Major are the islands of
    Bali, called Java Minor, and Madura, these are of equal size.</p>

  <p>They told us that in Java Major, it was the custom when one of the
    chief men died, to burn his body; and then his principal wife, adorned
    with garlands of flowers, has herself carried in a chair by four men
    throughout the town, with a tranquil and smiling countenance, whilst
    comforting her relations, who are afflicted because she is going to
    burn herself with the corpse of her husband, and encouraging them not
    to lament, saying to them, “I am going this evening to sup with my dear
    husband, and to sleep with him this night.” Afterwards, when close to
    the place of the pyre, she again turns towards the relations, and after
    again consoling them, casts herself into the fire and is burned. If she
    did not do this she would not be looked upon as an honourable woman,
    nor as a faithful wife.</p>

  <p>Our old pilot related to us other extravagant things. He told us that
    the young men of Java ... and that in an island called Ocoloro, below
    Java Major, there are only women who become pregnant with the wind,
    and when they bring it forth, if the child is a male, they kill it,
    and if a female, they bring it up; and if any man visits their island,
    whenever they are able to kill him, they do so.</p>

  <p>They also related to us that beyond Java Major, towards the north in
    the Gulf of China, which the ancients named Sinus Magnus, there is
    an enormous tree named Campanganghi,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> in which dwell certain
    birds named Garuda,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> so large that they take with their claws,
    and carry away flying, a buffalo, and even an elephant, to the place
    of the tree, which place is named Puzathaer. The fruit of this tree
    is called Buapanganghi, and is larger than a water melon. The Moors
    of Burné, whom we had with us in the ships, told us they had seen two
    of these birds, which had been sent to their king from the kingdom of
    Siam. No junk, or other vessel, can approach this tree within three or
    four leagues, on account of the great whirlpools which the water makes
    there. They related to us, moreover, how in a wonderful manner what
    is related of this tree became known, for a junk, having been carried
    there by the whirlpools, was broken up, and all the seamen perished,
    except a child who attached himself to a plank and was miraculously
    borne near the tree, upon which he mounted. There he placed himself
    under the wing of one of these birds, which was asleep, without its
    perceiving him, and next day the bird having taken flight carried him
    with it, and having seen a buffalo on the land, descended to take it;
    the child took advantage of the opportunity to come out from under its
    wing, and remained on the ground. In this manner the story of these
    birds and of the tree became known, and it was understood that those
    fruits which are frequently found in the sea came from that place.</p>

  <p>We were told that there were in that kingdom, on the banks of the
    rivers, certain birds which feed on carrion, but which will not touch
    it unless another bird has first eaten its heart.</p>

  <p>The Cape of Malacca is in 1 deg. 30 min. of S. latitude. To the east
    of that Cape are many cities and towns, of a few of which I will
    note the names—Singapola, which is at the Cape, Pahan, Kalantan,
    Patani, Bradlini, Benan, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>Lagon, Cheregigharan, Trombon, Joran, Ciu,
    Brabri, Banga, India, Jandibum, Laun, Langonpifa. All these cities are
    constructed like ours, and are subject to the King of Siam who is named
    Siri Zacabedera, and who inhabits Iudia.</p>

  <p>Beyond Siam is situated Camogia; its king is named Saret Zacabedera;
    next Chiempa, the king of which is named Raja Brahami Martu. There
    grows the rhubarb, and it is found in this manner: men go together in
    companies of twenty or twenty-five, to the woods, and at night ascend
    the trees, both to get out of the way of the lions, the elephants, and
    other wild beasts, and also to be able better to smell the odour of
    the rhubarb borne to them by the wind. In the morning they go to that
    quarter whence they have perceived that the odour comes, and seek for
    the rhubarb till they find it. This is the rotten wood of a large tree,
    which acquires its odour by putrefaction.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The best part of the
    tree is the root, but the trunk is also good, which is called Calama.</p>

  <p>The kingdom of Cocchi&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> lies next, its sovereign is named Raja
    Seri Bummipala. After that follows Great China, the king of which is
    the greatest sovereign of the world, and is called Santoa raja. He
    has seventy crowned kings under his dependence; and some of these
    kings have ten or fifteen lesser kings dependent on them. The port of
    this kingdom is named Guantan,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and among the many cities of this
    empire, two are the most important, namely Nankin and Comlaha, where
    the king usually resides.</p>

  <p>He has four of his principal ministers close to his palace, at the
    four sides looking to the four cardinal winds, that is, one to the
    west, one to the east, to the south, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>to the north. Each of these
    gives audience to those that come from his quarter. All the kings and
    lords of India major and superior obey this king, and in token of their
    vassalage, each is obliged to have in the middle of the principal place
    of his city the marble figure of a certain animal named Chinga, an
    animal more valiant than the lion; the figure of this animal is also
    engraved on the king’s seal, and all who wish to enter his port must
    carry the same emblem in wax or ivory.</p>

  <p>If any lord is disobedient to him, he is flayed, and his skin, dried
    in the sun, salted, and stuffed, is placed in an eminent part of the
    public place, with the head inclined and the hands on the head in the
    attitude of doing zongu, that is obeisance to the king.</p>

  <p>He is never visible to anybody; and if he wishes to see his people, he
    is carried about the palace on a peacock most skilfully manufactured,
    and very richly adorned, with six ladies dressed exactly like himself,
    so that he cannot be distinguished from them. He afterwards passes into
    a richly-adorned figure of a serpent called Naga, which has a large
    glass in the breast, through which he and the ladies are seen, but
    it is not possible to distinguish which is the king. He marries his
    sisters in order that his blood should not mix with that of others.</p>

  <p>His palace has seven walls round it, and in each circle there are
    daily ten thousand men on guard, who are changed every twelve hours
    at the sound of a bell. Each wall has its gate, with a guard at each
    gate. At the first stands a man with a great scourge in his hand,
    named Satuhoran&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> with Satubagan; at the second a dog called
    Satuhain;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> at the third, a man with an iron mace, called Satuhoran
    with pocumbecin;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> at the fourth, a man with a bow in his hand,
    called Satuhoran with anatpanan;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> at the fifth, a man with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>a
    lance, called Satuhoran, with tumach;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> at the sixth, a lion called
    Satuhorimau;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> at the seventh, two white elephants called Gagiapute.</p>

  <p>The palace contains seventy-nine halls, in which dwell only the ladies
    destined to serve the king; there are always torches burning there. It
    is not possible to go round the palace in less than a day. In the upper
    part of it are four halls where the ministers go to speak to the king:
    one is ornamented with metal, both the pavement and the walls; another
    is all of silver, another all of gold, and the other is set with pearls
    and precious stones. The gold and other valuable things which are
    brought as tribute to the king are placed in these rooms; and when they
    are there deposited, they say, Let this be for the honour and glory
    of our Santoa Raja. All these things and many others relating to this
    king, were narrated to us by a Moor, who said that he had seen them.</p>

  <p>The Chinese are white, and are clothed; they eat on tables like us.
    They have crosses, but it is not known why they have them.</p>

  <p>It is from China that musk comes; the animal which produces it is a
    kind of cat, like the civet cat; it eats nothing but a certain soft
    wood, slender as a finger, named chamaru. To extract the musk from
    this animal they attach a leech to it, and leave it till it is full
    of blood, and when they see that it is well filled, they crush it,
    and collect the blood in a plate, and put it in the sun for four or
    five days, moistening it every day with urine. In this way it becomes
    perfect musk. Whoever keeps one of these cats pays a tribute to the
    king. The grains of musk which come to Europe as musk, are only small
    pieces of kid’s flesh soaked in real <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>musk, and not the blood, since
    though it can be made into grains, it easily evaporates. The cat which
    produces musk is called castor, and the leech is called Linta.</p>

  <p>Continuing along the coast of China, many nations are met with, and
    they are these: the Chienchi, who inhabit the islands in which they
    fish for pearls, and where the cinnamon grows. The Lecchii inhabit the
    mainland: the entrance to their port is traversed by a large rock, for
    which reason all the junks and vessels which wish to enter must take
    down their masts. The king of this country is called Moni. He has on
    the mainland twenty kings under him, and he is subject to the King of
    China: his capital is Baranaci, and here is situated Oriental Cathay.
    Han is a high and cold island, where there is copper, silver, pearls,
    and silk; its king is named Raja Zotra. There is also Miliaula, the
    king of which is named Raja Quetischeniga, and Guio, the king of which
    is Raja Sudacali. These places are cold and on the mainland. Friagonba
    and Trianga are two islands which also produce copper, silver, pearls,
    and silk; their king is Raja Ruzon. Bassi is a low land on the
    continent. There come afterwards Sumbdit and Pradit, two islands very
    rich in gold, where the men wear a large ring of gold round the ankle.
    In the neighbouring mountains dwell people who kill their parents when
    they are old, so that they may cease from travail. All the people of
    these countries are Gentiles.</p>

  <p>Tuesday night (between it and Wednesday,) on the 11th of February of
    1522, we left the island of Timor, and entered upon the great sea named
    Laut Chidol,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and taking a west-south-west course, we left to the
    right and to the North, from fear of the Portuguese, the island of
    Zumatra, anciently named Taprobana; also Pegu, Bengala, Urizza, Chelim,
    where are the Malabars, subjects of the King of Narsinga: Calicut which
    is under the same king; Cambaya <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>in which are the Guzeratis; Cananor,
    Goa, Armus, and all the other coast of India major.</p>

  <p>In this kingdom dwell six classes of persons, that is to say: Nairs,
    Panicals, Franas, Pangelins, Macuas, and Poleas. The Nairs are the
    chiefs; the Panicals are the townspeople; these two classes live and
    converse together. The Franas collect the wine from the palm trees and
    the bananas. The Macuas are fishermen; and the Poleas sow and harvest
    the rice; these last always dwell in the fields, and never enter the
    city, and when it is desired to give them anything, it is placed on the
    ground and they take it. When they go along the roads they always cry
    out, po, po, po, that is take care of yourself; and we were told that a
    Nair who had been accidentally touched by a Polea, not to survive such
    a disgrace, had himself killed.</p>

  <p>In order to double the Cape of Good Hope, we went as far as 42° South
    latitude, and we remained off that cape for nine weeks, with the sails
    struck on account of the Western and North-western gales which beat
    against our bows with fierce squalls. The Cape of Good Hope is in 34°
    30′ South latitude, 1600 leagues distant from the Cape of Malacca, and
    it is the largest and most dangerous cape in the world.</p>

  <p>Some of our men, and among them the sick, would have liked to land at
    a place belonging to the Portuguese called Mozambique, both because
    the ship made much water, and because of the great cold which we
    suffered; and much more because we had nothing but rice and water for
    food and drink, all the meat of which we had made provision having
    putrified, for the want of salt had not permitted us to salt it. But
    the greater number of us, prizing honour more than life itself, decided
    on attempting at any risk to return to Spain.</p>

  <p>At length, by the aid of God, on the 6th of May, we passed that
    terrible cape, but we were obliged to approach it within only five
    leagues distance, or else we should never have passed it. We then
    sailed towards the north-west <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>for two whole months without ever taking
    rest; and in this short time we lost twenty-one men between Christians
    and Indians. We made then a curious observation on throwing them into
    the sea, that was that the Christians remained with the face turned
    to the sky, and the Indians with the face turned to the sea. If God
    had not granted us favourable weather, we should all have perished of
    hunger.</p>

  <p>Constrained by extreme necessity, we decided on touching at the Cape
    Verde Islands, and on Wednesday the 9th of July, we touched at one of
    those islands named St. James’s. Knowing that we were in an enemy’s
    country, and amongst suspicious persons, on sending the boat ashore
    to get provision of victuals, we charged the seamen to say to the
    Portuguese that we had sprung our foremast under the equinoctial line
    (although this misfortune had happened at the Cape of Good Hope), and
    that our ship was alone, because whilst we tried to repair it, our
    captain-general had gone with the other two ships to Spain. With these
    good words, and giving some of our merchandise in exchange, we obtained
    two boat-loads of rice.</p>

  <p>In order to see whether we had kept an exact account of the days, we
    charged those who went ashore to ask what day of the week it was, and
    they were told by the Portuguese inhabitants of the island that it was
    Thursday, which was a great cause of wondering to us, since with us
    it was only Wednesday. We could not persuade ourselves that we were
    mistaken; and I was more surprised than the others, since having always
    been in good health, I had every day, without intermission, written
    down the day that was current. But we were afterwards advised that
    there was no error on our part, since as we had always sailed towards
    the west, following the course of the sun, and had returned to the same
    place, we must have gained twenty-four hours, as is clear to any one
    who reflects upon it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>The boat, having returned for rice a second time
    to the shore, was detained, with thirteen men&NoBreak;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> who were in it. As we
    saw that, and, from the movement in certain caravels, suspected that
    they might wish to capture us and our ship, we at once set sail. We
    afterwards learned, some time after our return, that our boat and men
    had been arrested, because one of our men had discovered the deception,
    and said that the captain-general was dead, and that our ship was the
    only one remaining of Magellan’s fleet.</p>

  <p>At last, when it pleased Heaven, on Saturday the 6th of September
    of the year 1522, we entered the bay of San Lucar; and of sixty men
    who composed our crew when we left Maluco, we were reduced to only
    eighteen,&NoBreak;<a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and these for the most part sick. Of the others, some
    died of hunger, some had run away at the island of Timor, and some had
    been condemned to death for their crimes.</p>

  <p>From the day when we left this bay of San Lucar until our return
    thither, we reckoned that we had run more than fourteen thousand four
    hundred and sixty leagues, and we had completed going round the earth
    from East to West.</p>

  <p>Monday the 8th of September, we cast anchor near the mole of Seville,
    and discharged all the artillery.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, we all went in shirts and barefoot, with a taper in our hands
    to visit the shrine of St. Maria of Victory, and of St. Maria de
    Antigua.</p>

  <p>Then, leaving Seville, I went to Valladolid, where I presented to his
    Sacred Majesty Don Carlos, neither gold nor silver, but things much
    more precious in the eyes of so great a Sovereign. I presented to him
    among other things, a book written by my hand of all the things that
    had occurred day by day in our voyage. I departed thence as I was best
    able, and went to Portugal, and related to King John the things which I
    had seen. Returning through Spain, I came to France, where I presented
    a few things <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>from the other hemisphere to Madam the Regent, mother of
    the most Christian King Don Francis.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Afterwards, I turned towards
    Italy, where I established for ever my abode, and devoted my leisure
    and vigils to the very illustrious and noble lord, Philip de Villiers
    Lisleadam, the very worthy grand master of Rhodes.</p>

  <p>The armillary sphere, of which the author gives a drawing, serves
    to explain the system of the world according to Ptolemy, and could
    also serve as an astrolabe, for one sees at the top of it a kind of
    handle or ring, by which to hold it suspended, as is seen in the
    above-mentioned drawing. He begins his treatise by giving us an idea of
    that system, as have done all those after him, who have written of the
    elements of the nautical art and of pilotage.</p>

  <p>“The earth is round,” he says, “and remains suspended and immovable in
    the midst of all the celestial bodies. The first index fixed on two
    poles, the arctic and antarctic, which are supposed to correspond with
    the poles of the earth. It runs from East to West, and transports with
    itself all the planets and stars. Besides this there is the eighth
    sphere, the poles of which are at 23 deg. 33 min.,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> it runs from
    West to East.”</p>

  <p>“It is supposed that all the circumference of the earth is divided into
    360 degrees; and each degree is of 17 leagues and a half, consequently
    the circumference of the earth is 6,300 leagues. Land leagues are of
    three miles and sea leagues of four miles.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>“The ten circles of
    the armillary sphere, of which the six major pass through the center of
    the earth, serve to determine the situation of countries and climates.
    The Ecliptic determines the movement of the sun and the planets: the
    two Tropics indicate the point to which the sun declines from the
    equator towards the North in summer, and towards the South in winter.
    The Meridian, always variable, because it passes through all points of
    the equator, cutting it perpendicularly, designates the longitude, and
    it is on it that the latitudes are marked.”</p>

  <h3 class="smcap">Of Latitude.</h3>

  <p>After having well explained the armillary sphere with all its parts,
    and their use according to the system of Ptolemy, the author goes on
    to teach the method of taking the altitude of the pole, on which the
    latitude is calculated; fixing the pole at 0° and the equator at 90°.</p>

  <p>“The Polar star,” he says, “is not precisely on the point corresponding
    to the axis of the earth; but it turns round it, as do all the other
    stars. In order to know its true position with regard to the pole, it
    must be observed where the Guard stars&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> stand. If these are on the
    western arm,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> the polar star stands one degree above the pole: if
    they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>are on the line&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
    the pole star stands 3 deg. 30 min.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
    below the pole: if they are on the eastern arm the pole star is one
    degree below the pole. When one wishes to take the altitude of the pole
    star, in whichever of the above-mentioned four places the Guard stars
    may be, the degrees which the pole star has above the pole will be
    subtracted from its altitude, or those which it has below the pole will
    be added to it. I have spoken in the account of the voyage of the stars
    of the Antarctic Pole.”</p>

  <p>“The latitude of the place may also be ascertained by the sun’s
    altitude. 1. If you find yourself between the equinoctial and the
    arctic pole and the shadow falls towards that pole, look how many
    degrees and minutes meridianal declination the sun has that day; and
    this you will subtract from the altitude of the sun which you have
    taken: afterwards, deducting the remaining degrees from 90 deg., you
    will have in the residue the number of degrees of North latitude,
    that is your distance from the equator. 2. If the sun has a boreal
    declination, in such a manner that the shadow falls towards the south,
    take the sun’s declination on that day, and add it to the sun’s
    altitude which you have taken, from that sum subtract 90 degs., and the
    remaining degrees will indicate your boreal latitude. 3. If the sun is
    between the equinoctial and the antarctic, and the shadow falls towards
    the antarctic, observe the sun’s declination for that day, subtract it
    from the altitude taken, according to the first rule, and you will have
    the degrees of south latitude. 4. If, when you and the sun are between
    the equinoctial and the antarctic pole, the shadow falls towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
    the north, you will add the altitude you have taken to the sun’s
    declination that day, and act according to the second rule. 5. When you
    have an altitude of 90 deg., you will be so many degrees distant from
    the equator as there are degrees of the sun’s declination, and if the
    sun has no declination you will be under the equator. 6. If you are to
    the north of the equator, and the sun is in the southern signs you will
    look what is its declination, you will add these degrees of declination
    to those of the altitude observed, and as many degrees as are wanting
    from 90 deg., so many will you be distant from the equinoctial. 7.
    You will do the same when you find yourself to the south of the
    equinoctial, whilst the sun is in the northern signs.”</p>

  <h3 class="smcap">Of Longitude.</h3>

  <p>“Longitude indicates the degrees from east to west: I have considered
    many methods or means for ascertaining it, and I have found three
    methods&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> fitting for that object. The last is the most convenient
    for those who do not know astrology. At the present time the pilots
    content themselves with knowing the latitude; and are so proud that
    they will not hear speak of longitude.”</p>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">i.</span> From the latitude of the moon the longitude is calculated
    of the place in which the observation is made. The distance of the moon
    from the ecliptic is called its latitude: the ecliptic is the path of
    the sun. The moon, in its movement, always increases its distance until
    it reaches the furthest point of its distance: and thence it returns
    back, to diminish, so to say, its latitude, until it is with the head
    or tail of the dragon:&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> there it cuts the ecliptic. And since <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>the
    moon, whilst it lengthens its distance from the ecliptic, has more
    degrees towards the west than towards the east, it must necessarily
    have more latitude on one side (<em>of the globe</em>) than on the other:
    and when the latitude is known, by measuring the degrees and minutes
    with the astrolabe, it will be known whether it is found, and how far
    it is found towards the east or the west. But in order to ascertain
    the longitude, you must know in what latitude the moon ought to be at
    that same moment in the place from which you sailed, for instance, in
    Seville. By knowing the latitude and longitude of the moon at Seville
    in degrees and minutes, and seeing also the latitude and longitude
    which it has in the place where you are, you will know how many hours
    and minutes you are distant from Seville; and afterwards you will
    calculate the distance in east or west longitude.”</p>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">ii.</span> The moon furnishes another method for ascertaining the
    longitude, but that is when I knew the precise hour in which the moon
    observed at Seville ought to be in conjunction with a given star or
    planet, or ought to be in a certain opposition to the sun, of which the
    degrees are determined: and this I can know by means of an almanack.
    And since that happens in the east before it happens in the west, as
    many as may be the hours and minutes that may elapse from the time
    when the conjunction took place at Seville, till the time in which I
    observe it to take place, so much will be my longitude west of Seville.
    But if I should see the conjunction take place before the hour in
    which it ought to happen with respect to Seville, then my distance in
    longitude will be east. For each hour, fifteen degrees of longitude are
    calculated.”</p>

  <figure class="figright illowp33" id="i_169">
    <img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="">
  </figure>

  <p>“To understand this does not require any great genius. It should be
    borne in mind that the moon has a motion opposed to the general motion
    of the heavens; that is, it goes from west to east, and in every two
    hours it progresses <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>a degree and a few minutes; and since it is in
    the first heaven, and the stars are in the eighth, it certainly never
    enters in conjunction with them; but sometimes it interposes itself
    before the rays which come from them to our eye: but this does not
    happen at the same time to those who are at Seville, and to those who
    are at Valencia. The annexed figure will give an idea of this, from
    which it is seen that the ray of the star <span class="smcap">d</span> is intercepted by
    the moon <span class="smcap">c</span> for those who are at <span class="smcap">a</span>, and not for those
    who are at <span class="smcap">b</span>, for whom it was intercepted when the moon was at
    <span class="smcap">e</span>.”</p>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">iii.</span> The compass can also supply a method, still easier, for
    finding the longitude of the place in which you are. It is known that
    the compass, or the magnetised needle which is in it, directs itself to
    a given point, because of the tendency which the loadstone has towards
    the pole. The reason of this tendency is because the loadstone does not
    find in the heavens any other spot in repose except the pole, and on
    that account directs itself towards it. This is an explanation of the
    phenomenon which I propose; and I believe it to be true, so long as
    experience does not inform us of some better explanation.”</p>

  <p>“In order to know, by means of the needle, the degrees of longitude,
    form a large circle, in which place the compass, and divide it into 360
    deg.: and having placed the needle at 360 deg., where it indicates the
    arctic pole; when the needle is in repose, draw a thread, which should
    pass from the arctic pole, pointed out by the needle to the antarctic
    pole, and let this thread be longer than the diameter. After that take
    the south, which you will know by the greatest <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>altitude of the sun.
    Turn the compass, until the thread which traverses it coincides with
    the direction of the meridian shade; then, from the antarctic pole of
    the needle, with the thread which remained over, draw another thread
    to the arctic pole, that is, to the flower;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> and you will thus
    find how many degrees the needle of the compass is distant from the
    meridian line, that is, from the true pole. So many will be the degrees
    of longitude, which you will have from the place where the compass
    begins to set itself in motion.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Therefore, with the more accuracy
    you take the true meridian so much the more exactly will you be able
    to ascertain the degrees of longitude. And from this it may be seen
    that the meridian should never be taken with the compass, because it
    north-easts or north-wests,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> as soon as it goes out of the true
    meridian; but take an observation of the south&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> with the astrolabe,
    and judge that it is midday when the sun is at its greatest height.”</p>

  <p>“If it is not possible to take the sun’s altitude at midday, that can
    be determined with an hour-glass of sand, taking the hours of the night
    from sunset till the moment of its rising. Having learned the hours
    of the night, you will know how many are wanting of the twenty-four,
    and these you will divide into two equal parts. When half of this has
    elapsed, be sure that it is midday, and that the shadow indicates to
    you the true meridian. But since the sand clock may often be inexact,
    it will be better to take the sun’s altitude with the astrolabe
    by means of its mediclino.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>“The true meridian may also be
    ascertained, or rather the equinoctial line, which cuts the meridian
    at right angles, by observing the points where the sun rises and sets,
    and by observing how much they are distant from the equinoctial either
    to the north or to the south. For this purpose an astrolabe is formed
    with the globe; that is, a circle is made representing the earth’s
    circumference, divided into 360 deg. At sunrise fix two pins in the
    circumference, in such a manner that a line drawn from one to the other
    should pass through the centre, and place the pins so that both should
    be in a line opposite the sun’s center. Place two other pins in the
    same way in the circumference when the sun sets. You will thus see how
    much the sun declines from the equinoctial line, either to the north
    or to the south. And as many degrees as the pins are distant from the
    equinoctial, so many degrees are the sun’s declination. Having found
    the sun’s rising and setting, you will also find the medium distance;
    that is, the meridian line, and afterwards you will see how much the
    compass or magnetic needle north-easts or north-wests. You will infer
    from this how far you are from the Fortunate islands; that is, from
    Tenerife towards the east or the west. This method has been tried by
    experience.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

  <h3 class="smcap">Direction of the Ship.</h3>

  <p>“If you wish to navigate to any place, you must first know its
    position; that is, its latitude and longitude. Then, by means of the
    compass you will point directly to that place. And since the compass
    varies to east and west, you must, by the methods above described,
    ascertain its variation, and subtract or add that which is necessary,
    so that the ship’s head, regulated by the compass, may have the
    required direction.”</p>

  <p>“Should the compass be lost, or if its variation east or west is not
    known, you may regulate yourself by the sun at midday. When you have
    fixed the meridian in such a manner that it cuts the ship in its width,
    it will be easy to direct the prow wherever you wish. Here is an
    example: suppose you wish to go from north-east to south-west, place
    the chart in such manner that the ship should have her head to west and
    the poop to the east; then on the circle of the winds, divided into
    360, or in four times 90, fix two pins, one at 45 degrees between east
    and north, the other at 45 degrees between west and south; bring the
    two pins on the line of the meridian by turning the ship’s head for
    that purpose, and the prow will be directed to the place to which you
    are going. If the pins do not come in a line with the meridian, it is a
    sign that you are navigating in a false direction, and you must rectify
    the course. When you reach land, you will see that what I have said is
    true.”</p>

  <p>“With an astrolabe made with plates,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> observations may be taken of
    the meridian line, the poles, and the equinoctial <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>line, at any hour of
    the day or night, looking at the moon or any star; and for these, place
    in the middle of the astrolabe instead of the <i>verghezita</i> or
    sight,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> two straight bars between which you will observe the star.”</p>

  <p>Thus the method being known by which the required direction is given
    to the ship, the author teaches the method for determining the point
    or degree on the chart of the winds,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> to which the ship on leaving
    a place to go to a given country should be directed. For clearness, he
    gives some examples of this. “Do you wish,” he says, “to go from south
    to north, or <i>vice versâ</i>, on the same longitude? always proceed
    on the same meridian. Do you wish to go from east to west, or <i>vice
    versâ</i>, in the same latitude? always proceed on the same parallel.
    Do you wish to go from one place to another as many degrees distant
    in longitude as it is different in latitude? Then take the course of
    45 degrees either to the south-west or south-east, or north-west or
    north-east. If the latitude is greater than the longitude, then add to
    the 45 degrees as many degrees towards the nearest pole, as the number
    of degrees by which the latitude exceeds the longitude. For instance,
    if I wish to go from Cape St. Vincent to Cape Bojador, I reckon the
    degrees of longitude and those of latitude to know the difference
    between these two capes. I find that the degrees of longitude are five
    and a half, and those of latitude are eleven, from which I subtract the
    degrees of longitude and there remain 5 deg. 30 min. Then, instead of
    going in the direction of from north-east to south-west (as I should
    do if the longitude were equal to the latitude), I go from 5 deg. 30
    min. above north-east towards north, to 5 deg. 30 min. below south-west
    towards south. If the longitude is greater than the latitude, the
    lesser number is still subtracted from the greater; and the direction
    will be 45 deg. after deducting the residue. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>For instance, do you
    want to go from the island of Ferro to Guadeloupe; you know that the
    first is in 27 deg. latitude and the second in 15 deg.; then take their
    difference, which is 12 deg.: look at the map for their longitude,
    and you see that Ferro is in 1 deg. and Guadeloupe in 45 deg., whence
    their difference is 44 deg.: subtract from these the 12 deg. residue of
    latitude, and there remain 32 deg. Then you must subtract these 32 deg.
    from 45 deg., and there will remain 13 deg. Therefore your course will
    be from north-east 13 deg. north to south-west 13 deg. south.”</p>

  <h3 class="smcap">Direction of the Winds.</h3>

  <p>“The rose of the winds, divided into 360 deg., will give a clearer idea
    of what has been here said; it being well understood that the pilot
    must place the center of the winds on the point from which he starts,
    or from which he takes the course, and he must fix the pole to the true
    pole observed from the sun, and not trusting to the compass, which
    north-easts or north-wests.”</p>

  <p>“Then, to ascertain whence comes the wind, place a little stick with a
    little sail&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> in the centre of your rose or circle of winds, divided
    into 360 deg., and placed in such a manner that north and south stand
    on the true Solar meridian. The direction of the vane moved by the wind
    will indicate exactly which wind blows: on the equinoctial is east
    and west; at 45 deg. there is north-east, south-west, north-west, and
    south-east; at 22&NoBreak;1⁄2 deg. towards north you have north-north-east, and
    so on with the others.”</p>

    from shop to shop to get information of the value of spices, and with
    this he gave cause that he did not return to his country, although

    quarter-masters of that ship, as I have understood that it seems to
    you all a serious matter, that I am determined to go forward, because

    with long reasons for going forward; and he swore by the habit of St.

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>The voyage made by the Spaniards round the world in the space of three
    years is one of the greatest and most marvellous things which have been
    heard of in our times; and, although in many things we surpass the
    ancients, yet this expedition far excels every other that has been made
    up till now. The voyage was described very minutely by Peter Martyr,
    who belonged to the Council of the Indies of His Majesty the Emperor,
    and to whom was entrusted the duty of writing this history; and by
    him were examined all those who remained alive of that expedition,
    and who reached Seville in the year 1522. But, as it was sent to be
    printed in Rome, it was lost in the miserable sacking of that city; and
    nothing is known even now as to where it is. And he who saw it, and
    read it, bears testimony to the same; and, amongst other things worthy
    of recollection that the aforesaid Peter noted concerning the voyage,
    was this, that the Spaniards, having sailed about three years and one
    month, and the greater part of them, as is usual amongst seafaring
    men, having noted down the days of the months one by one, found, when
    they arrived in Spain, that they had lost a day, for the day on which
    they arrived at Seville, which was the 7th of September, was, by their
    reckoning, the 6th. And the aforesaid Peter having mentioned this
    peculiarity to a certain excellent and extraordinary man, who was at
    that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>time ambassador for his Republic to His Majesty; and, having
    asked him how it could be, he, who was a great philosopher and learned
    in Greek and Latin literature, so that for his singular learning and
    rare excellence, he was afterwards promoted to much higher rank, gave
    this explanation: That it could not have fallen out otherwise, as they
    had travelled for three years continuously and always accompanied the
    sun, which was going westward. And he told him besides, that those
    who sailed due westwards towards the sun, lengthen their day very
    much, as the ancients also had noticed. Now, the book of the aforesaid
    Peter having disappeared, Fortune has not allowed the memory of so
    marvellous an enterprise to be entirely lost, inasmuch as a certain
    noble gentleman of Vicenza called Messer Antonio Pigafetta (who, having
    gone on the voyage and returned in the ship <i>Victoria</i>, was made
    a Knight of Rhodes), wrote a very exact and full account of it in a
    book, one copy of which he presented to His Majesty the Emperor, and
    another he sent to the most Serene Mother of the most Christian King,
    the Lady Regent. She entrusted to an excellent Parisian philosopher
    called Jacomo Fabre, who had studied in Italy, the work of translating
    it into French.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> This worthy person, I suppose to save himself
    trouble, made only a summary of it, leaving out what seemed fit to him;
    and this was printed, very incorrectly, in France, and has now come
    into our hands; and along with it a letter from one called Maximilianus
    of Transylvania, a secretary of His Majesty the Emperor, to the most
    Reverend Cardinal of Salzburg. And this we have wished to add to this
    volume of travels, as one of the greatest and most remarkable that
    there has ever been, and one at which those great philosophers of old,
    hearing of it, would have been stupified and beside themselves. And
    the city of Vicenza may well boast, among the other cities of Italy,
    that in addition to its nobility <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>and high qualities; in addition to
    its many rare and excellent geniuses, both in letters and arms, there
    has been a gentleman of such courage as the aforesaid Messer Antonio
    Pigafetta, who has circumnavigated the whole globe, and has described
    it so exactly. There is no doubt that the ancients would have erected
    a statue of marble to him, and would have placed it in an honourable
    position, as a memorial and example to posterity of his great worth,
    and in acknowledgment of so stupendous an enterprise. But if, in this
    letter or in the summary, there be seen any discrepancy of names or
    things, let no one be astonished; for the bent of men’s minds is
    various, and one notices one thing and one another, just as the things
    appear most deserving of attention. Let it suffice if, in the principal
    things they agree, and many parts which are left out in one can be read
    at length in the other. Fabulous stories, too, are noted for what they
    are. This may be safely affirmed by anyone, that the ancients never had
    such a knowledge of the world, which the sun goes round and examines
    every twenty-four hours, as we have at present, through the industry of
    the men of these our times.</p>

  <p>Most Reverend and Illustrious Lord, my only Lord, to you
    I most humbly commend myself.</p>

  <p>One of those five ships has lately returned which Cæsar sent in former
    years, when he was living at Saragossa, to a strange, and for so many
    ages, an unknown world, in order to search for the islands where spices
    grow. For though the Portuguese bring a great quantity of them from
    the Golden Chersonesus, which we now suppose to be Malacca, yet their
    own Indies produce nothing but pepper. Other spices, such as cinnamon,
    cloves, and the nutmeg, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>we call muscat, and its covering (mace),
    which we call muscat flower, are brought to their own Indies from
    distant islands till now only known by name, and in ships which are
    fastened together not by iron but by palm leaves. The sails of these
    ships are round and woven, too, of the palm-fibre. This sort of ships
    they call junks, and they only use them with a wind directly fore and
    aft.</p>

  <p>It is no wonder that these islands should be unknown to any human
    beings almost up to our time. For whatever we read concerning the
    native soil of the spices has been told us by ancient authors, and is
    partly, certainly, fabulous; and, partly, so far from the truth, that
    even the very countries in which they said that they grew naturally,
    are but little less distant from those where it is now known that they
    grow, than we are. For to omit others, Herodotus, in other respects a
    most famed author, has said that cinnamon is found in birds’ nests,
    to which the birds have brought it from most distant regions, and
    specially the Phœnix, and I know not who has seen his nest. But Pliny,
    who thought himself able to give more certain information, because,
    before his time, many things had been made clear by the voyages of the
    fleets of Alexander the Great and of others, relates that cinnamon
    grows in Æthiopia on the borders of the land of the Troglodytæ, whilst
    now it is known that cinnamon is produced very far from any part of
    Æthiopia, and specially from the Troglodytæ (that is, the dwellers in
    subterranean caverns). But our men, who have now returned, and who
    were perfectly acquainted with Æthiopia, have been obliged to make a
    complete circuit of the world, and that a very wide one, before they
    could find the islands and return. As this voyage may be considered
    marvellous, and not only unaccomplished, but even unattempted either
    in our age or in any previous one, I have resolved to write as truly
    as possible to your Reverence the course (of the expedition) and the
    sequence of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>whole matter. I have taken care to have everything
    related to me most exactly by the captain and by the individual sailors
    who have returned with him. They have also related each separate
    event to Cæsar and to others with such good faith and sincerity,
    that they seemed not only to tell nothing fabulous themselves, but
    by their relation to disprove and refute all the fabulous stories
    which had been told by old authors. For who can believe that these
    were Monosceli, Scyopodæ, Syritæ, Spitamei, Pygmies, and many others,
    rather monsters than men. And as so many places beyond the Tropic of
    Capricorn have been sought, found, and carefully examined, both by the
    Spaniards in the south-west and by the Portuguese sailing eastwards,
    and as the remainder of the whole world has now been sailed over by
    our countrymen, and yet nothing trustworthy has been heard concerning
    these man-monsters, it must be believed that the accounts of them are
    fabulous, lying, and old women’s tales, handed down to us in some way
    by no credible author. But lest I, who have to travel over the whole
    world, should seem too diffuse in my introduction, I return to my
    story. When, nearly thirty years ago, the Spaniards in the west, and
    the Portuguese in the east, began to search for new and unknown lands,
    their two kings, lest one should be a hindrance to the other, divided
    the whole globe between them by the authority, most likely, of Pope
    Alexander the Sixth, in this manner: that a straight line should be
    drawn 360 miles, which they call leucæ, west of the islands of the
    Hesperides, which are now called the islands of Cape Verd; towards
    the north, and another towards the south Pole, till they should meet
    again, and so divide the world into two equal parts. And whatever
    strange land should be discovered eastwards (of this line) should be
    ceded to the Portuguese, and whatever west of it to the Spaniards. In
    this manner it happened that the Spaniards always sailed south-west,
    and there they discovered a very large continent and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>very great and
    innumerable islands, rich in gold and pearls and in other wealth, and
    now, quite lately, have they discovered the vast Mediterranean city,
    Tenostica,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> situated in a lake, like Venice. About this city Peter
    Martyr, an author more careful about his facts than the elegance of
    his style, has written many wonderful, and yet true, things. But the
    Portuguese, passing southwards by the shores of the Hesperides, and
    of the ichthyophagous Æthiopians, and crossing the equinoctial line
    and the Tropic of Capricorn, sailed eastward, and discovered many
    great and unknown islands, and afterwards the sources of the Nile and
    the land of the Troglodytæ. Thence they sailed past the Arabian and
    Persian Gulfs to the shores of India, within the Ganges, where there is
    now the mighty emporium and kingdom of Calicut. Thence they sailed to
    Taprobanes, which they now call Zamatara. For there is now no island
    which either can be, or can be supposed to be, Taprobanes, in the
    position in which Ptolemy, Pliny, and the other cosmographers placed
    it. Going thence, they arrived at the Golden Chersonesus, where now is
    situated that most famous city of Malacca, the greatest emporium of
    the East. After this they entered the Great Gulf,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> which reaches
    as far as the country of the Sinæ, which they now call Schinæ, where
    they found a white and tolerably civilised people, like our Germans.
    They believe that the Seres and the Asiatic Scythians extend as far as
    there. And though there was a certain rumour afloat that the Portuguese
    had progressed so far to the east as to cross their own limits and
    enter the territory of the Spaniards, and that Malacca and the Great
    Bay were within our limits, still all these things were said rather
    than believed, until four years ago Ferdinand Magellan, a distinguished
    Portuguese, who, for many years had explored the coasts of the whole
    of the East as Admiral, took a great hatred to his king, whom he
    complained of as being most <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>ungrateful to him, and came to Cæsar.
    Christopher Haro, too, my own father-in-law’s brother, who had traded
    for many years in the East by means of his agents, he himself staying
    in Ulyssipone, commonly called Lisbon, and who had lastly traded with
    the Chinese, so that he has great practice in such things, having
    also been unjustly treated by the King of Portugal, came also home to
    Spain. And they both showed Cæsar that though it was not yet quite
    sure whether Malacca was within the confines of the Spaniards or the
    Portuguese, because, as yet, nothing of the longitude had been clearly
    proved, yet that it was quite plain that the Great Gulf and the people
    of Sinæ lay within the Spanish boundary. This, too, was held to be most
    certain, that the islands which they call the Moluccas, in which all
    the spices are produced, and are thence exported to Malacca, lay within
    the Spanish western division, and that it was possible to sail there;
    and that spices could be brought thence to Spain more easily, and at
    less expense and cheaper, as they came direct from their native place.</p>

  <p>Their course would be this, to sail westward, coasting the southern
    hemisphere (till they came) to the East. The thing seemed almost
    impossible and useless, not because it was thought a difficult thing to
    go from the west right to the east under the hemisphere, but because
    it was uncertain whether ingenious nature, which has done nothing
    without the greatest foresight, had not so dissevered the east from
    the west, partly by sea and partly by land, as to make it impossible
    to arrive there by either land or sea travelling. For it had not then
    been discovered whether that great region which is called Terra Firma
    did separate the western sea from the eastern; it was clear enough
    that that continent, in its southern part, trended southwards and
    afterwards westwards. It was clear, also, that two regions had been
    discovered in the North, one of which they called Regio Bacalearum
    (Cod-fish Land), from a new kind of fish; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>and the other Terra Florida.
    And if these two were united to that Terra Firma, it was impossible
    to get to the east by going from the west, as nothing had ever been
    discovered of any channel through this land, though it had been sought
    for most diligently and with great labour. And they considered it a
    very doubtful and most dangerous enterprise to go through the limits
    of the Portuguese, and so to the east. For which reason it seemed to
    Cæsar and to his counsellors that these men were promising a thing from
    which much was to be hoped, but still of great difficulty. When they
    were both brought to an audience on a certain day, Magellan offered
    to go himself, but Christopher offered to fit out a fleet at his own
    expense and that of his friends, but only if it were allowed to sail
    under the authority and protection of Cæsar. Whilst they both persisted
    rather obstinately in their offers, Cæsar himself equipped a fleet of
    five ships, and appointed Magellan its admiral. Their orders were, to
    sail southwards along the coast of Terra Firma till they found either
    its termination or some channel through which they might reach the
    spice-bearing Moluccas. So Magellan set sail on the 10th of August,
    1519, with five ships from Seville. A few days after he reached the
    Fortunate Islands, which are now sometimes called the Canaries. Thence
    they arrived at the Islands of the Hesperides,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> from which they
    took a south-western course towards that continent which we mentioned
    before; and after some days’ fair sailing they sighted a promontory, to
    which the name of Santa Maria has been given. Here Juan Ruy Diaz Solis
    had been eaten, with some of his companions, by the anthropophagi, whom
    the Indians call cannibals, whilst, by order of Ferdinand the Catholic,
    he was exploring the coast of this continent with a fleet. Sailing
    thence, our men coasted in an unbroken course along the coasts of this
    continent, which extend a very long way south, and tend a little west,
    so that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>they crossed the Tropic of Capricorn by many degrees. I think
    that this continent should be called that of the Southern Pole. But it
    was not so easy as I have said; for not till the last day of March of
    the following year did they reach a bay, to which they gave the name of
    Saint Julian. Here they found the Antarctic Pole star 49&NoBreak;1⁄5 degrees
    above their horizon, both by the altitude and declination of the sun
    from the Equinoctial, and also by the altitude of the Antarctic (Pole
    star) itself. This star our sailors generally make use of more than
    of any other. They state also that the longitude was 56 deg. west of
    the Fortunate Isles. For, as the ancient cosmographers, and specially
    Ptolemy, reckoned the longitude from the Fortunate Islands eastward
    to Catigara at 180 deg., so our men, sailing as far as they could
    westward also, began to reckon another 180 deg. westward to Catigara,
    as was right. Yet our sailors seem to me rather to be mistaken in the
    calculation of the longitudes (of distances?) than to have fixed them
    with any certainty, because in so long a voyage, and being so distant
    from the land, they cannot fix and determine any marks or signs for the
    longitude. Still I think that these accounts, whatever they be, should
    not be cast aside, but rather accepted till more certain information be
    discovered.</p>

  <p>This Gulf of Saint Julian seemed very great, and had the appearance of
    a channel. Wherefore Admiral Magellan ordered two ships to explore the
    Gulf and anchored the rest outside. After two days, information was
    brought to him that the Gulf was full of shoals, and did not extend
    far inland. Our men, on their way back, saw some Indians picking up
    shell-fish on the shore; for they call the natives of all unknown lands
    Indians. They were of extraordinary height, that is to say, about ten
    spans, were clothed in the skins of wild beasts, and seemed darker than
    would be expected from the situation of the country. When some of our
    men went on shore to them and showed them bells <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>and pictures painted
    on paper, they began a hoarse chant and an unintelligible song, dancing
    round our men, and, in order to astonish them, they passed arrows
    a cubit and a half long down their throats to the bottom of their
    stomachs, and without being sick. And forthwith drawing them out again,
    they seemed to rejoice greatly, as having shown their bravery by this
    exploit.</p>

  <p>At last three came as ambassadors, and prayed our men, by certain
    signs, to go further inland with them, as if they would receive them
    with all hospitality. Magellan sent seven men, well armed, with them,
    to investigate as carefully as possible both country and people. When
    they had gone with them about seven miles inland, they came to a thick
    and pathless wood.</p>

  <p>Here was a rather low hut, covered with skins of wild beasts. There
    were two apartments in it; in one lived the women with their children,
    in the other the men. There were thirteen women and children, and
    five men. These received their guests with a (ferali apparatu&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>)
    barbarous pomp, which seemed to them a royal one. An animal was
    slaughtered, which seemed to differ little from the onager, and they
    served it up half roasted to our men, without any other food or drink.
    Our men were obliged, contrary to their custom, to sleep under skins,
    on account of the severity of the snow and wind. Wherefore, before they
    slept, they set watch. The Indians did the same, and lay down near our
    men, snoring horribly.</p>

  <p>When the day had broken, our men asked them to return with them
    to the ships, with the whole family. When the Indians had refused
    for a considerable time, and our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>men had insisted upon it rather
    imperiously, the men entered the den-like&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> women’s apartment. The
    Spaniards thought that they were consulting with their wives concerning
    this expedition; but they returned covered, from the sole of their feet
    to the crown of their heads, with different horrible skins, and with
    their faces painted in different colours, and equipped in this terrible
    and horrible garb with bows and arrows for battle, and (seemingly?) of
    much greater stature than before. The Spaniards, who thought that it
    would come to a fight, ordered (a shot) to be fired. Though this shot
    was harmless, still the giants, who looked just before fit to contend
    with Jove, were so frightened by this sound, that they began forthwith
    to speak of peace. The upshot was, that three men returned with our
    fellows to the ships, having sent away the rest of the family. So they
    started for the ships. But, as our men could not only not keep up with
    these almost giants when the latter were running, but could not, even
    by running, keep up with them walking, two of them escaped upon the
    march, on the pretext of pursuing an onager, which they saw feeding
    at a distance upon a mountain. The third was brought to the ship,
    but died, within a few days, of fasting, which he had imposed upon
    himself, according to the habit of the Indians, through homesickness.
    And though the admiral sent again to that hut, in order to catch some
    one of these giants to take to Cæsar on account of their novelty,
    yet no one was found there, but all had gone elsewhere with the hut.
    Whence it seems clear that that race is a wandering one, nor did our
    men ever see another Indian on that coast, though they remained in
    that bay for many days, as we shall mention farther on. They did not
    think that there was anything in that region of sufficient importance
    to justify their exploring it and the interior any farther. Though
    Magellan perceived that any longer stay there was useless, yet, as the
    sea for several <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>days was stormy and the sky threatening, and the land
    stretched continuously southwards, so that the farther they went the
    colder they would find that region, his departure was necessarily put
    off from day to day, till the month of May was close upon them, from
    which time the winter there begins to be most severe, so that it became
    necessary to winter at the very time when we have our summer. Magellan
    foreseeing that the voyage would be a long one, ordered provisions
    to be served out more sparingly among his crews, so that the stock
    might last longer. When the Spaniards had borne this patiently for
    some days, fearing the severity of the winter and the barrenness of
    the country, they at last petitioned their admiral, Magellan, that, as
    he saw that the land stretched uninterruptedly to the south, and that
    no hope remained of its terminating or of the discovery of a strait
    through it, and that a severe winter was imminent, and that many of
    them were dead of starvation and hardships; and declared that they
    could no longer bear the rule which he had made about the allowance
    of provisions (lex sumptuaria), and begged that he would increase
    the allowance of provisions, and think about going home; that Cæsar
    never intended that they should too obstinately attempt what nature
    itself and other obstacles opposed; that their exertions were already
    sufficiently known and approved of,—for they had gone farther than
    either the boldness or rashness of mortals had ever dared to go as yet;
    and that they could easily reach some milder shore, if they were to
    sail south (north?) for a few days, a south wind being then blowing.
    But in reply, Magellan, who had already made up his mind either to die
    or to complete his enterprise, said that his course had been laid down
    for him by Cæsar himself, and that he neither could nor would depart
    from it in any degree, and that he would in consequence sail till he
    found either the end of the land or some strait (through it).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>That
    though they could not at present succeed whilst winter was against
    them, yet that it would be easy in the summer of that region. But that,
    if they would continue towards the Antarctic portion of this country,
    the whole of its summer would be one perpetual day. That there were
    means if they would only try them, by which they might avoid famine and
    the rigour of the winter, inasmuch as there was abundance of wood, and
    the sea provided shell-fish and many sorts of the very best fish. The
    springs there were wholesome, and birdfowling and hunting would supply
    many wants; and neither bread nor wine had as yet been lacking, nor
    would they lack in future if they would only bear that they should be
    served out when needed, or for health’s sake, and not for pleasure or
    for luxury. They had done nothing as yet worthy of admiration, or which
    could serve as an excuse for their return, inasmuch as the Portuguese
    crossed the tropic of Capricorn by as much as 12 deg. not only every
    year, but almost every day, when they were sailing eastwards. They
    would be thought worthy of very little praise who had gone only 4 deg.
    southwards. He had certainly made up his mind to endure the worst
    rather than return ignominiously to Spain, and he trusted that all his
    comrades, or at least those in whom the noble Spanish spirit was not
    yet dead, would be of the same mind.</p>

  <p>He advised them to bear at least the remainder of the winter patiently,
    and said that their rewards would be the more abundant the more
    difficulties and dangers they had endured in opening to Cæsar a new
    unknown world, rich in spices and gold. Magellan thought that the minds
    of his crews were soothed and cheered by this harangue, but within a
    few days was harassed by a shameful and foul conspiracy. For talking
    began amongst the crews about the old eternal hatred between the
    Portuguese and the Spaniards, and about Magellan’s being a Portuguese.
    He, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>they said, could do nothing more glorious for his own country than
    to cast away this fleet, with so many men. Nor was it credible that
    he should wish to discover the Moluccas, even if he were able; but he
    would think it sufficient if he could hire Cæsar on for some years with
    a vain hope, and meanwhile something new would turn up, by which the
    Spaniards would for the future be diverted from the search for spices.
    Nor even had their course begun to turn towards those happy Moluccas,
    but rather to distant snows and ice, and to perpetual storms.</p>

  <p>Magellan, very much enraged by these sayings, punished the men, but
    rather more harshly than was proper for a foreigner, especially when
    commanding in a distant country. So, having planned a conspiracy, they
    seize upon a ship, and make ready to return to Spain. But he, with the
    rest whom he had still obedient to his commands, attacked that ship,
    and put to death the head man and the other ringleaders, those even
    who could not lawfully be so treated sharing the same fate. For these
    were certain servants of the king, upon whom no one but Cæsar and his
    Council could lawfully pronounce a sentence of death. Nevertheless,
    no one from that time dared to disparage the power of the commander.
    Still, there were not wanting some who whispered that Magellan would,
    in the same manner, murder all the Spaniards to the last man, until he,
    having got rid of them all, might return with the few Portuguese with
    the fleet to his own country. And so this hatred settled more deeply in
    the hearts of the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>As soon as ever Magellan saw the storminess of the sea and the rigour
    of the winter mitigated, he set sail from the gulf of St. Julian on the
    24th of August. And, as before, he followed the course of the coast
    southwards for many days. A promontory was at last sighted, which
    they called Santa Cruz, when a severe storm, springing from the east,
    suddenly caught them, and one of the five ships was cast <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>on shore, the
    men being all saved, with the merchandise and equipment, except one
    Ethiopian slave, who was caught and drowned by the waves. After this
    the land seemed to bear a little east and south, and this they began
    to coast along as usual, and on the 26th of November certain inlets
    of the sea were discovered, which had the appearance of a strait.
    Magellan entered them forthwith with the whole fleet, and when he saw
    other and again other bays, he gave orders that they should be all
    carefully examined from the ships, to see if anywhere a passage might
    be discovered; and said that he would himself wait at the mouth of the
    strait till the fifth day, to hear what might happen.</p>

  <p>One of the ships, which Alvarus Meschito, his nephew, commanded, was
    carried back by the tide to the sea, to the very place where they
    entered the gulf. But when the Spaniards perceived that they were
    far away from the other ships, they made a plot to return home, put
    Alvarus, their captain, in irons, bent their course northwards, and
    were at last carried to the coast of Æthiopia (Guinea), and, having
    victualled there, they reached Spain eight months after they had
    deserted the rest. There they compel Alvarus to stand his trial in
    chains (causam ex vinculis dicere faciunt quasi), for having, by
    his counsel and advice, induced his uncle Magellan to practise such
    harshness on the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>But when Magellan had waited for this ship some days longer than the
    time fixed, another returned, which had discovered nothing but a bay
    full of shoals and shingle, and very lofty cliffs. The third ship,
    however, reported that the largest bay had the appearance of a strait,
    as in three days’ sail they had found no way out; but the farther they
    had gone the narrower the sea was, and they had not been able to sound
    the depth of it in many places by any length of line, and that they had
    also noticed that the tide was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>rather stronger than the ebb, and that
    so they were persuaded that a passage was open in that direction to
    some other sea. He made up his mind to sail through it. This channel,
    which they did not then know to be a channel, was at one place three
    Italian miles wide, at another two, sometimes ten, and sometimes five,
    and pointed a little westward. The altitude of the southern pole was
    found to be 52 deg., and the longitude to be the same, as at St.
    Julian’s Bay. The month of November was upon them (Aderat jam mensis
    Novembris), the night was rather more than five hours long, and they
    had never seen any human beings on the shore.</p>

  <p>But one night a great number of fires were seen, mostly on their left
    hand, from which they guessed that they had been seen by the natives
    of the region. But Magellan, seeing that the country was rocky, and
    also stark with eternal cold, thought it useless to waste many days in
    examining it; and so, with only three ships, he continued on his course
    along the channel, until, on the twenty-second day after he had entered
    it, he sailed out upon another wide and vast sea. The length of the
    channel they attest to be nearly a hundred Spanish miles.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that the land which they had upon their right was the
    continent of which we have spoken, but they think that the land on the
    left was not a mainland, but islands, because sometimes on that side
    they heard on a still farther coast the beating and roaring of the sea.</p>

  <p>Magellan saw that the continent stretched northwards again in a
    straight line; wherefore, leaving that huge continent on the right
    hand, he ordered them to sail through that vast and mighty sea (which
    I do not think had ever seen either our or any one else’s ships) in
    the direction whence the wind called Corus&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> generally blows—that
    is, ’twixt north and west—so that he might, by going through <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>west
    to east, again arrive at the torrid zone; for he thought that it was
    proved sufficiently clearly that the Moluccas were in the most remote
    east, and could not be far from the equator. They kept this course
    uninterruptedly, nor did they ever depart from it, except when rough
    weather or violent winds compelled them to diverge; and when they had
    in this manner been carried for forty days by a strong and generally
    favourable wind, and had seen nothing but sea, and everywhere sea—when
    they had almost reached the tropic of Capricorn once more, two islands
    were sighted, but small and barren. These they found uninhabited when
    they tried to land; still, they stopped there two days for their
    health’s sake, and general recruiting of their bodies, for there was
    very fair fishing there. They named these the Unfortunate Islands
    by common consent. Then they again set sail thence, following their
    original course and direction of sailing. And when, for three months
    and twenty days, they had been sailing over this ocean with great good
    fortune, and had traversed an immense part of the sea—more vast than
    mind of man can conceive, for they had been driven almost continuously
    by a very strong wind—they were now at last arrived on this side of
    the equinoctial line, and at last they saw an island, called, as they
    learnt afterwards, Inuagana by the natives. When they had approached
    nearer, they discovered the altitude of the Arctic pole to be 11 deg.
    The longitude they thought to be 158 deg. west of Gades. Then they
    saw other and still more islands, so that they knew they had arrived
    at some vast archipelago. When they reached Inuagana, the island was
    discovered to be uninhabited. They then approached a rather small
    island, where they saw two Indian canoes—for that is the name by which
    this strange kind of boat is called by the Indians. The canoes are cut
    and hollowed out of a single trunk of a tree, and hold one, or, at
    most, two men; and they usually speak by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>gestures and signs, as if the
    dumb were talking with the dumb.</p>

  <p>They asked the Indians the names of the islands, and where they could
    get provisions, of which they were in great want. They understood that
    the island in which they had been was called Inuagana, and that the
    one where they now were was Acaca, but both of them uninhabited. They
    said that there was an island not far off, which was called Selani, and
    which they almost showed with their finger, and that it was inhabited,
    and that an abundance of everything necessary for life was to be found
    there.</p>

  <p>Our men, having taken in water in Acaca, sailed towards Selani; here
    a storm took them, so that they could not bring the ships to that
    island, but were driven to another island called Massaua, where lives a
    king of (the?) three islands, after that they arrived at Subuth. This
    is an excellent and large island, and, having made a treaty with its
    chieftain, they landed immediately to perform divine service, according
    to the manner of Christians, for it was the feast of the resurrection
    of Him who was our salvation. Wherefore they built a small chapel of
    the sails of the ships, and of boughs, and in that they built an altar
    according to the Christian rites, and performed service after their
    home fashion. The chieftain came up with a great number of Indians, who
    seemed in every way delighted by this worship of the gods. They led the
    admiral and some of the officers to the chief’s hut, and put before
    them whatever food they had. Their bread, which they call sago, was
    made of the trunk or wood of a tree, rather like a palm. This, when cut
    in pieces, and fried in oil in a pan, supplies them with bread, a small
    piece of which I send to your reverence. Their drink was a liquor which
    flows and trickles from the boughs of the palm-trees when cut. Fowling,
    too, supplied the feast, and the rest was the fruit of that region.</p>

  <p>Magellan beheld, in the chief’s hut, one sick, and almost <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>at the last
    gasp. He asked who he was, and what illness he was suffering from. He
    learnt that he was the chief’s grandson, and had now suffered for two
    years from a raging fever. But he told him to be of good cheer, and
    that he would immediately recover his health and former strength, if he
    would only become a Christian. The Indian accepted the condition, and,
    having adored the Cross, he received baptism, and the next day declared
    that he was well, rose from his bed, walked, and took food like the
    rest. He told I know not what visions to the Indians. What need I say
    more? The chief himself, with two thousand two hundred Indians, was
    baptized, and professed the name and religion of Christ. But Magellan,
    judging this island to abound in gold and ginger, and, besides, to be
    convenient from its position with respect to the neighbouring islands,
    for exploring with ease their wealth and produce of the earth, goes to
    the Chief of Subuth, and persuades him that as he had abandoned that
    vain and impious worship of the gods, and had turned to the religion
    of Christ, it was only fair that the kings of the neighbouring isles
    should be subject to his rule and command; and he said that he had
    resolved to send ambassadors concerning this, and compel by arms those
    who did not listen to his command.</p>

  <p>This proposition pleased the savage, and the ambassadors were sent.
    The chiefs came in one by one, and did homage. The nearest island was
    called Mauthan, the king of which excelled the others in number of
    soldiers and in arms, and he refused to do homage to one whom he had
    been accustomed for so long to command.</p>

  <p>Magellan, who desired to finish what he had once begun, gave orders
    that forty of his men, whose bravery and prowess he had proved, should
    arm, and he crossed over to Mauthan in boats, for the island was very
    near. The Chief of Subuth added some of his own men to show him the
    situation of the island, and to fight, if matters came to that. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>The
    King of Mauthan, seeing our men coming, draws up about three thousand
    of his subjects in the field, and Magellan draws up his on the shore,
    with their guns and warlike engines, though only a few; and though he
    saw that he was far inferior to the enemy in number, yet he thought it
    better to fight this warlike race, which made use of lances and other
    long weapons, than either to return or to use the soldiers from Subuth.
    So he orders his men to be of good cheer and brave hearts, and not to
    be alarmed at the number of the enemy, for they had often seen, as
    formerly, so in quite recent times, two hundred Spaniards in the island
    of Yucatan put sometimes two or three hundred thousand men to flight.
    But he pointed out to the Subuth islanders that he had brought them,
    not to fight, but to watch their bravery and fighting power (robur in
    acie). So, having charged the enemy, both sides fought valiantly: but,
    as the enemy were more numerous, and used longer weapons, with which
    they did our men much damage, Magellan himself was at last thrust
    through and slain. But the rest of our men, though they did not seem
    quite conquered, yet retreated, having lost their leader. And the enemy
    dared not follow them, as they were retreating in good order.</p>

  <p>So the Spaniards, having lost their admiral, Magellan, and seven of
    their comrades, returned to Subuth, where they chose another commander,
    John Serrano, a man not to be despised. He immediately renewed with
    fresh gifts the alliance that had been made with the King of Subuth,
    and promised to subdue the King of Mauthan.</p>

  <p>Magellan had a slave, born in the Moluccas, whom he had bought in
    Malacca some time back; this man was a perfect master of the Spanish
    language, and, with the assistance of one of the islanders of Subuth
    as interpreter, who knew the language of the Moluccas, our men managed
    all their communications. This slave had been present at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>the battle of
    Mauthan, and had received some slight wounds in it. For which reason
    he lay all day long nursing himself. Serrano, who could manage nothing
    without him, spoke to him very harshly, and told him that he had not
    ceased to be a slave and bondsman because Magellan was dead, but that
    the yoke of slavery would be heavier, and that he would be severely
    flogged unless he did the services required of him more zealously.</p>

  <p>This slave conceived an intense hatred of us from these words; but,
    concealing his anger, he went a few days after to the Chief of Subuth,
    and told him that the greed of the Spaniards was insatiable, that they
    had resolved and determined, after they had conquered the King of
    Mauthan, to make a quarrel with him and take him away prisoner, and
    there was no other remedy possible than to anticipate their treachery
    by treachery. The savage believed it all. He made peace secretly with
    the King of Mauthan and the others, and they plotted our destruction.
    Serrano, the commander, with all the rest of his officers, who were
    about twenty-seven in number, were invited to a solemn banquet. They,
    suspecting no evil—for the savages had cunningly dissimulated in
    everything—land, careless and unsuspecting, as men who were going to
    dine with the chief would do. Whilst they were feasting they were set
    upon by those who had been placed in ambush. Shouts were raised on all
    sides, and news flew to the ships that our men were murdered, and that
    everything on the island was hostile to us. Our men see from the ships
    that the beautiful cross which they had hoisted on a tree was hurled to
    the ground, and kicked to pieces by the savages with great fury. But
    the remaining Spaniards, who had stopped on board, when they knew of
    their comrades’ murder, feared some still greater treachery. Wherefore,
    when they had weighed anchor, they begin to set sail quickly. Shortly
    after, Serrano was brought down to the shore bound most cruelly, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>and
    he begged them to redeem him from so harsh a captivity. He said he had
    prevailed upon them to permit his being ransomed, if our men would only
    do it.</p>

  <p>Though our men thought it shameful to leave their commander in
    this way, yet, fearing fraud and treachery, they put out to sea,
    leaving Serrano on the shore, weeping bitterly, and imploring the
    help and assistance of his fellow-countrymen with great and grievous
    lamentation. The Spaniards sailed along, sad and anxious, having lost
    their commander and their shipmates, not only alarmed by their loss and
    by the slaughter of their mates, but because their number was reduced
    so low that it was quite insufficient for the management of three
    ships. Wherefore they hold a council, and, having taken the votes, they
    agree that there was nothing better to do than to burn some one of the
    three ships, and keep only two.</p>

  <p>So they go to an island near, Cohol&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> by name, and transfer the
    equipment to the other two ships, and burn the third. Then they sailed
    to the island called Gibeth. Though they found that it was rich in
    gold and ginger and many other things, yet they thought it better not
    to stay there long, because they could not, by any kindness, attract
    the Indians to them. And their scantiness of number prevented their
    fighting. Thence they went to the island Porne (Borneo). There are two
    great and rich islands in this archipelago, one of which was called
    Siloli, the king of which had six hundred children; and the other Porne.</p>

  <p>Siloli was greater than the one called Porne. For it takes nearly
    six months to sail round it, but Porne only three. But just so much
    as the former is larger, so much is the latter better situated as
    regards fertility of soil, and more famed also for the size of a city
    of the same name as itself. And, as Porne must be considered of more
    importance than any of the other islands which they had examined, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>seemed to be the source whence the others received their good customs
    and civilization (cultum vitæ), I have resolved to touch, in a few
    words, upon the customs and laws of these peoples. All these islanders
    are Caphræ, that is, heathen, and worship the sun and moon. They
    ascribe the rule of the day to the sun, but that of the night to the
    moon; the former they call male, and the latter female; and them, too,
    they call the parents of the stars, which they deem to be all gods,
    though small ones. They salute the rising sun with certain hymns before
    they worship it. This they do also to the moon, when it shines at
    night, to whom they pray for children, and fruitful increase of cattle,
    and abundant fruits of the earth, and other things of that sort.</p>

  <p>But they practise justice and piety, and specially do they love peace
    and quiet, but war they greatly detest, and they honour their king as
    a god whilst he is bent upon peace. But if he be too desirous of war,
    they rest not till he has fallen by the hand of the enemy in battle.
    Whenever he has determined to wage war, which is rarely done, he is
    placed by his subjects in the vanguard, where he is compelled to bear
    the whole onslaught of the enemy. Nor do they fight against the enemy
    with any spirit until they know that their king is dead; then, first do
    they begin to fight for their liberty and for their future king, nor
    has there ever been seen among them a king who began a war who has not
    died in battle. Wherefore they rarely wage war, and think it unjust to
    extend their territories; but the special care of all is not wantonly
    to attack either the neighbouring or the distant peoples. But if at any
    time they are attacked, they meet force by force (par pari referunt).
    But lest the mischief should spread farther they look immediately to
    making peace. There can be nothing more honourable among them than
    to be the first to ask for peace, nor more disgraceful than to be
    anticipated in asking for it, and they think it shameful and hateful to
    refuse it to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>anyone, even if he had attacked them without provocation.
    And all the neighbouring people unite against the one (who refuses
    peace) for his destruction, as against a cruel and impious man. Whence
    it happens that they almost always enjoy quiet and repose. There is no
    robbery among them, and no murder. No one but his wives and children
    may speak to the king, except by means of canes, which they place to
    his ear from a distance, and whisper what they wish through them. They
    say that man, after his death, has no feeling, as he had none before
    his birth. They have small houses, built of logs and of earth, partly
    roofed with rubble, and partly with palm leaves. [Ædes habent exiles ex
    lignis &amp; terra constructas, partim rudere, partim palmatis frondibus
    coopertas.] It is, though, quite certain that in Porne there are twenty
    thousand houses. They marry as many wives as they can afford, and live
    on food, which bird-fowling or fishing supplies them with. They make
    bread of rice, and a drink which drops from the severed branches of the
    palm, as we said before.</p>

  <p>Some carry on traffic in the neighbouring islands, to which they go
    in junks; some devote themselves to hunting; some to fishing; and
    others to agriculture. They have dresses of cotton, and almost all the
    animals that we have, except the sheep, the ox, and the ass; but their
    horses are very small and feeble. The produce of camphor, of ginger,
    and of cinnamon, is great among them. Thence our men, having saluted
    this king, and heaped him with presents, directed their course to the
    Moluccas, which had been pointed out to them by the same king. They
    came to the shores of the island of Solo, where they heard that there
    were pearls as big as dove’s eggs, and sometimes as hen’s eggs, but
    which can only be fished up from the very deepest sea. Our men brought
    no large pearl, because the season of the year did not allow of the
    fishery. But they testify that they had taken an oyster in that region,
    the flesh of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>which weighed forty-seven pounds. For which reason I
    could easily believe that pearls of that great size are found there;
    for it is clearly proved that pearls are the product of shell-fish. And
    to omit nothing, our men constantly affirm that the islanders of Porne
    told them that the king wore in his crown two pearls of the size of a
    goose’s egg. Hence they went to the island of Gilo, where they saw men
    with ears so long and pendulous, that they reached to their shoulders.
    When our men were mightily astonished at this, they learnt from the
    natives that there was another island not far off where the men had
    ears not only pendulous, but so long and broad, that one of them would
    cover the whole head, if they wanted it (<span lang="la">cum ex usu esset</span>). But our
    men, who sought not monsters but spices, neglecting this nonsense, went
    straight to the Moluccas, and they discovered them eight months after
    their admiral, Magellan, had fallen in Mauthan. The islands are five in
    number, and are called Tarante, Muthil, Thidore, Mare, and Matthien:
    some on this side, some on the other, and some upon the equinoctial
    line.</p>

  <p>One produces cloves, another nutmegs, and another cinnamon. All are
    near to each other, but small and rather narrow.</p>

  <p>The kings (of?) Marmin began to believe that souls were immortal a
    few years ago, induced by no other argument than that they saw that
    a certain most beautiful small bird never rested upon the ground nor
    upon anything that grew upon it; but they sometimes saw it fall dead
    upon the ground from the sky. And as the Mahometans, who travelled to
    those parts for commercial purposes, told them that this bird was born
    in Paradise, and that Paradise was the abode of the souls of those who
    had died, these kings (reguli) embraced the sect of Mahomet, because
    it promised wonderful things concerning this abode of souls. But they
    call the bird Mamuco Diata, and they hold it in such reverence and
    religious esteem, that they believe that by it their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>kings are safe
    in war, even though they, according to custom, are placed in the fore
    front of battle. The common folk are Caphræ, and of almost the same
    manners and laws as the islanders of Porne; they are rather poor, as
    would be likely with people in whose land nothing grows except spices.
    These they willingly barter for poisons, namely, arsenic and what is
    commonly called sublimate of mercury, and for linens, in which they
    generally are dressed; but for what purpose they use these poisons,
    we have not yet found out. They live on sago bread and fish, and
    sometimes on parrots, and they shelter in low huts. What need of many
    words. Everything there is humble, and of no value, but peace, quiet,
    and spices. The best and noblest of which, and the greatest good
    possible, namely, peace, seems to have been driven by men’s wickedness
    from our world to theirs. But avarice and the insatiable greed of the
    belly, have driven us to seek for spices in their unknown world. (<span lang="la">Adeo
    hominum protervia salubria quaeque haud longius satis nequet protudere
    neque quæ luxus et libidinis appetere.</span>) But, our men having carefully
    inspected the position of the Moluccas and of each separate island, and
    also having inquired about the habits of the kings, went to Thedori,
    because they learnt that in that island the supply of cloves was far
    above that of the others, and that its king also surpassed the other
    kings in wisdom and humanity. So, having prepared their gifts, they
    land, and salute the king, and they offer the presents as if they had
    been sent by Cæsar. He, having received the presents kindly, looks up
    to heaven, and says: “I have known now for two years from the course of
    the stars, that you were coming to seek these lands, sent by the most
    mighty King of Kings. Wherefore your coming is the more pleasant and
    grateful to me, as I had been forewarned of it by the signification of
    the stars.”</p>

  <p>And, as I know that nothing ever happens to any man <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>which has not been
    fixed long before by the decree of fate and the stars, I will not be
    the one to attempt to withstand either the fates or the signification
    of the stars, but willingly and of good cheer, will henceforth
    lay aside the royal pomp and will consider myself as managing the
    administration of this island only in the name of your king. Wherefore
    draw your ships into port, and order the rest of your comrades to land;
    so that now at last, after such a long tossing upon the seas, and so
    many dangers, you may enjoy the pleasures of the land and refresh your
    bodies. And think not but that you have arrived at your king’s kingdom.
    Having said this, the king, laying aside his crown, embraced them one
    by one, and ordered whatever food that land afforded to be brought.
    Our men being overjoyed at this, returned to their comrades, and told
    them what had happened. They, pleased above measure with the friendly
    behaviour and kindness of the king, take possession of the island.
    And when their health was completely restored, in a few days, by the
    king’s munificence, they send envoys to the other kings, to examine
    the wealth of the islands, and to conciliate the other kings. Tarante
    was the nearest, and also the smallest, of the islands; for it has a
    circumference of a little more than six Italian miles. Mathien is next
    to it, and it, too, is small. These three produce a great quantity of
    cloves, but more every fourth year than the other three. These trees
    only grow on steep rocks, and that so thickly as frequently to form a
    grove. This tree is very like a laurel (or bay tree) in leaf, closeness
    of growth, and height; and the gariophile which they call clove from
    its likeness (to a nail, clavus) grows on the tip of each separate
    twig. First a bud, and then a flower, just like the orange flower is
    produced.</p>

  <p>The pointed part of the clove is fixed at the extreme end of the
    branch, and then growing slightly longer, it forms a spike. It is at
    first red, but soon gets black by the heat of the sun. The natives keep
    the plantations of these trees <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>separate, as we do our vines. They bury
    the cloves in pits till they are taken away by the traders.</p>

  <p>Muthil, the fourth island, is not larger than the rest, and it
    produces cinnamon. The tree is full of shoots, and in other respects
    barren; it delights in dryness, and is very like the tree which bears
    pomegranates. The bark of this splits under the influence of the sun’s
    heat, and is stripped off the wood; and, after drying a little in the
    sun, it is cinnamon. Near to this is another island, called Bada,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
    larger and more ample than the Moluccas. In this grows the nutmeg, the
    tree of which is tall and spreading, and is rather like the walnut
    tree, and its nut, too, grows like the walnut; for it is protected
    by a double husk, at first like a furry calix, and under this a thin
    membrane, which embraces the nut like network. This is called the
    Muscat flower with us, but by the Spaniards mace, and is a noble and
    wholesome spice. The other covering is a woody shell, like that of
    hazel-nut, and in that, as we have already said, is the nutmeg. Ginger
    grows here and there in each of the islands of the archipelago. It
    sometimes grows by sowing, and sometimes spontaneously; but that which
    is sown is the more valuable. Its grass is like that of the saffron,
    and its root is almost the same too, and that is ginger. Our men were
    kindly treated by the chiefs in turn, and they, too, submitted freely
    to the rule of Cæsar, like the King of Thidori. But the Spaniards, who
    had but two ships, resolved to bring some of each (spice) home, but to
    load the ships with cloves, because the crop of that was most abundant
    that year, and our ships could contain a greater quantity of this kind
    of spice. Having, therefore, loaded the ships with cloves, and having
    received letters and presents for Cæsar from the kings, they make ready
    for their departure. The letters were full of submission and respect.
    The gifts were Indian swords, and things of that sort. But, best of
    all, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>the Mamuco Diata; that is, the Bird of God, by which they believe
    themselves to be safe and invincible in battle. Of which five were
    sent, and one I obtained from the captain (con gran prieghi), which
    I send to your reverence, not that your reverence may think yourself
    safe from treachery and the sword by means of it, as they profess to
    do, but that you may be pleased by its rareness and beauty. I send also
    some cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves, to show that our spices are not
    only not worse, but more valuable than those which the Venetians and
    Portuguese bring, because they are fresher. When our men had set sail
    from Thedori, one of the ships, and that the larger one, having sprung
    a leak, began to make water, so that it became necessary to put back
    to Thedori. When the Spaniards saw that this mischief could not be
    remedied without great labour and much time, they agreed that the other
    ship should sail to the Cape of Cattigara, and afterwards through the
    deep as far as possible from the coast of India, lest it should be seen
    by the Portuguese, and until they saw the Promontory of Africa, which
    projects beyond the Tropic of Capricorn, and to which the Portuguese
    have given the name of Good Hope; and from that point the passage to
    Spain would be easy. But as soon as the other ship was refitted, it
    should direct its course through the archipelago, and that vast ocean
    towards the shores of the continent which we mentioned before, till it
    found that coast which was in the neighbourhood of Darien, and where
    the southern sea was separated from the western, in which are the
    Spanish Islands, by a very narrow space of land. So the ship sailed
    again from Thedori, and, having gone twelve degrees on the other side
    of the equinoctial line, they did not find the Cape of Cattigara, which
    Ptolemy supposed to extend even beyond the equinoctial line; but when
    they had traversed an immense space of sea, they came to the Cape of
    Good Hope and afterwards to the Islands of the Hesperides. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>And, as
    this ship let in water, being much knocked about by this long voyage,
    the sailors, many of whom had died by hardships by land and by sea,
    could not clear the ship of the water. Wherefore they landed upon one
    of the islands, which is named after Saint James, to buy slaves. But
    as our men had no money, they offered, sailor fashion, cloves for the
    slaves. This matter having come to the ears of the Portuguese who were
    in command of the island, thirteen of our men were thrown into prison.
    The rest were eighteen in number. Frightened by the strangeness of this
    behaviour, they started straight for Spain, leaving their shipmates
    behind them. And so, in the sixteenth month after leaving Thedori, they
    arrived safe and sound on the sixth of September, at the port near
    Hispalis (Seville). Worthier, indeed, are our sailors of eternal fame
    than the Argonauts who sailed with Jason to Colchis. And much more
    worthy was their ship of being placed among the stars than that old
    Argo; for that only sailed from Greece through Pontus, but ours from
    Hispalis to the south; and after that, through the whole west and the
    southern hemisphere, penetrating into the east, and again returned to
    the west.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, 29th day of November, I began to take the altitude of the sun
    whilst following the said voyage; and whilst in the vicinity of Cape
    St. Augustine, and in 7° altitude on the S. side, and at a distance
    from the said cape a matter of 27 leagues to S.W. Wednesday, 30th of
    said month, I took the sun in 76°, and its declination was 22° 59′, and
    its polar altitude was 8° 59′, and the course was S.S.W.</p>

  <p>On the 1st December, Thursday, the sun had 78° meridian altitude, and
    23° 4′ declination, and our distance (from the equator) 11° 4′, and the
    course was S.S.W.</p>

  <p>Friday, the 2nd of the said month, I took the sun in barely 80°, and
    its declination was 23° 3′, the altitude was just 13°, and the course
    S.S.W.</p>

  <p>Saturday, the 3rd of the said month, I took the sun in 82° 15′, which
    had 23° 13′ declination, and our distance was 14° 58′, and the course
    was S.S.W.</p>

  <p>Sunday, the 4th of the said month, the sun had 83° altitude, and 23°
    17′ declination; and our distance came to be 16° 17′, and the course
    was S.S.W.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>Monday, 5th of the said month, I took the sun in barely
    84°, and it had 23° 21′ declination; and our distance to the South came
    to be 17° 13′, and the course was S.S.W. 1⁄4 W.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, 6th of the said month, the sun had 85° meridian altitude, and
    23° 25′ declination; and the height to the S. Pole came to be 18° 25′;
    the course was S.W. 1⁄4 S.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, 7th of the said month, I took the sun in 86° 30′, and it had
    23° 29′ declination; our distance from the line came 18° 57′, and the
    course was to W.S.W.</p>

  <p>Thursday, 8th of the said month, I took the sun in 86° 30′, and it had
    23° 29′ declination; and so our altitude came to be 19° 59′, and the
    course was S.W., and we sounded here, and found bottom at 10 fathoms;
    and this day we saw land, flat beaches, and it was the day of the
    Conception of our Lady.</p>

  <p>Friday, 9th of the said month (December), I took the sun in 88°, and
    its declination was 23° 31′; and our distance from the equinoctial line
    towards the South part came to be 21° 31′, and the course was S.S.W.,
    and we arose in the morning to the right of St. Thomas, on a great
    mountain, and south slopes along the coast in the S.S.W. direction;
    and on this coast, at 4 leagues to sea, we found bottom at 25 fathoms,
    free from shoals; and the mountains are separated one from another,
    and have many reefs round them; and in Brazil and St. Thomas there are
    many rivers and ports; and going along the coast 6 leagues there are
    many shoals 2 leagues out to sea, and there is a depth of 12 fathoms on
    them, and 10, and 8; but the coast runs N.E. and S.W. to Cape Frio, and
    there are many islands and rivers.</p>

  <p>At Cape Frio there is a very large river, and to the N.E., at three
    leagues distance, there is the peak of a high mountain and three
    islands; and the cape is in 23°, and at the said cape there are three
    islands, and you leave them outside. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>Passing the said cape there is
    a large bay, and at its entrance there is a low island, and the bay
    within is very large, with many ports; it extends two leagues from the
    mouth, and it is called Bay of St. Lucy; and if you wish to pass the
    island, you leave it on the left hand, and (the entrance) is narrow;
    but there is a depth of 7 fathoms, and a foul bottom; but outside
    there is a depth of 20 to 25 fathoms, and within, where there is
    anchorage, there are 18 fathoms. In this bay there are good people,
    and plenty of them, and they go naked, and barter with fish-hooks,
    and looking-glasses, and little bells, for victuals. There is a good
    deal of brazil wood, and this bay is in 23°, and we entered here the
    day of St. Lucy, and remained till the day of St. John, which is the
    27th of the month of December; and we set sail the same day, and went
    to W.S.W., and found seven islets, and to the right of them there is
    a bay, and it is called the Bay of Kings; it has a good entrance, and
    in this neighbourhood, on the 31st of the month, I took the sun in 86°
    45′, and its declination was 22° 8′, and our latitude came to be 25°
    23′.</p>

  <p>Sunday, 1st of January of the year 1520, I took the sun in 84°, and it
    had 21° 23′ declination; and the altitude from the pole came to be 27°
    29´; and on the days after the first day we went to S.W., and the other
    to W. and the fourth day to S.W. 1⁄4 S. Thursday, the 5th, the sun was in
    85° 30′ of altitude, and 23° 19′ of declination; so that our distance
    from the line came to be 29° 49′, and the course was S.W. 1⁄4 S.</p>

  <p>On the 6th, the day of the Kings, the sun was in barely 80°, and had
    21° 8′ of declination; and the altitude from the pole came to be 31°,
    and the course was S.W. 1⁄4 W.</p>

  <p>Saturday, the 7th, I took the sun in 78°; it had 20° 56′ of
    declination, and our parallel was 32° 56′; the course was to S.W. 1⁄4 S.,
    and we went along the coast.</p>

  <p>On the 8th I did not take the sun, but we went to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>S.W. 1⁄4 S., and at
    night we sounded and found 50 fathoms; and we altered the course, and
    went on the 9th of the said month to W.S.W.; and in the morning we
    sounded, and found 15 fathoms, and we went till midday, and saw land,
    and there I took the sun in 76°, and it had 20° 31′ of declination; and
    at night we anchored in a bottom of 12 fathoms—34° 31′.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, 10th January (1520), I took the sun in 75°; it had a
    declination of 20°, and our latitude came to 35°. We were to the right
    of the Cape of Sta. Maria. Thence forward the coast runs East and West,
    and the land is sandy; we gave it the name of Montevidi (now they call
    it correctly Santovidio), and between it and the Cape S<sup>ta</sup> Maria
    there is a river which is called (de los Patos) Duck River. From thence
    we went on forward through fresh water, and the coast runs E.S.E. and
    W.N.W. for ten leagues distance; after that it trends N.E. and S.W. as
    far as 34&NoBreak;1⁄2°, with a depth of 5, 4 and 3 fathoms; there we anchored,
    and sent the ship <i>Santiago</i> along the coast to see if there
    was a roadstead, and the river is in 33&NoBreak;1⁄2°. To the N.E. we found
    some islets, and the mouth of a very large river (it was the river of
    Solis), and it went to the N. Here they turned back to the ships, and
    the said ship was away from us a matter of 25 leagues, and they were
    15 days in coming; and during this time two other of our ships went
    in a southerly direction to see if there was a roadstead for staying
    at; and those went in the space of two days, and the Captain-General
    went thither, and they found land to the S.S.W., 20 leagues distance
    from us, and they were four days in coming; and on returning we took
    in water and wood, and we went away from there, tacking from one tack
    to the other with contrary winds, until we came in sight of Montevidi;
    and this was on the 2nd day of the month of February, the day of our
    Lady of the Candlemas; and at night we anchored at 5 leagues from the
    mountain, and it lay to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>the S.E. and a quarter S. of us. Afterwards,
    on the morning of the 3rd, we set sail for the South, and we sounded,
    and found 4, 5, 6, and 7 fathoms, always increasing in depth; and this
    day we took the sun in 68° 30′; it had 13° 35′ declination, and our
    latitude came to 35°.</p>

  <p>Saturday, 4th February, we anchored in a depth of seven fathoms, the
    ship San Antonio having got leaky, and we were there till the 5th, and
    afterwards we weighed on the 6th, and stood on the south course, and at
    night we anchored in eight fathoms, and remained there till next day.</p>

  <p>The 7th we set sail to reconnoitre better the coast, and we saw that
    it trended S.E. 1⁄4 S.; after that we took another tack and anchored
    in 8 fathoms, and there we took the sun in 66° 30′, and it had 12°
    15′ declination, with which our distance from the equinoctial line to
    the south came to be 35&NoBreak;3⁄4°; after that we sailed the same day, and
    at night we anchored in 9 fathoms, and stood for Cape Santanton [Cabo
    Blanco] it was to the south in 36°, and this was Tuesday, the 7th.</p>

  <p>On the 8th we set sail from the said point, and it is north and south
    with Montevidi, and 27 leagues distant from it; this coast runs N. and
    S. [the width of the Rio de la Plata is 27 leagues]; from that place
    forward we went along the coast round the cape of St. Polonia; after
    that the coast trends from N.E. to S.W. The said cape is in 37°, and
    the land sandy and very low, it has sea of shallow depth for a distance
    of two leagues from land, of 8, 9, and 10 fathoms; so we ran all this
    day to the S.W., and the night and day.</p>

  <p>Thursday, 9th of February, I took the sun in 63&NoBreak;1⁄4°; it had 11&NoBreak;1⁄2°
    declination, and the altitude came to be 38° 30′; the coast can be
    sounded, and not very high nor mountainous, and we made out many smokes
    along the coast; this coast runs E.W. 1⁄4 N.W. S.E., and the point is
    called Punta de las Arenas.</p>

  <p>On the 10th I took the sun in 62°1⁄3, and it had 11° 8′ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>declination,
    our distance from the equinoctial came to be 38° 48′, and the coast
    runs E. W., and it is a very pretty coast for running in one or other
    direction.</p>

  <p>On the 11th of the said month, I took the sun in 62°, it had 10° 47′
    declination, and the altitude came to be 38° 47′, and the course was W.
    1⁄4 N.W., and the coast ran east and west from the Point do las Arenas;
    to this place there is a very good coast, with soundings, with many
    little green hills and low land.</p>

  <p>Sunday the 12th, we did not take the sun, but from the day before
    till midday we began to run to S.W. and to S.W. and a quarter W., and
    to W.S.W., and W. and a quarter S.W., but I calculate that the whole
    course was W.S.W., and this run was from midday of the 11th, till
    nightfall of the 12th, and at that hour we anchored in 9 fathoms, and
    further on in 13 fathoms, and after that we had anchored we saw land,
    and we set sail to the N., and this was on the 13th, and in the morning
    we were alongside of some shoals, where the Victoria bumped several
    times.</p>

  <p>Item, the same day we were at anchor, and we did not take the sun’s
    altitude, and we were in soundings of 7 fathoms, and we remained there
    till the 14th, and the said day I took the sun in 60&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and it had
    9° 41′ declination, and our altitude came to 39° 11′.</p>

  <p>On the 15th of the said month I took the sun in 60°, and it had 9° 13′
    declination, and our distance came to be 39° 19′, and we sailed a south
    course.</p>

  <p>Thursday the 16th, we could not take the sun until the 18th, and on
    that day we were in 39&NoBreak;1⁄4°; and the next day, the 19th, we were in
    39&NoBreak;1⁄3°, and this day we went to S.W., and we went by this course, and
    could not take the sun until the 20th of the month.</p>

  <p>On the 20th I took the sun in 57°, it had 7° 27′ declination, and our
    distance to the south came to 40° 17′.</p>

  <p>On the 21st, I took the sun in 55°, it had 7° 4′ declination, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>our
    altitude came to 42° 4′, the course was S.W. 1⁄4 W., and we sounded and
    found bottom at 55 fathoms.</p>

  <p>Wednesday the 22nd, I took the sun in 53°, it had 6° 41′ declination,
    and our distance came to 43° 26′, the course was S.W. 1⁄4 W.; at night
    we sounded and found bottom at 55 fathoms.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd I took the sun in 53&NoBreak;1⁄4°, it had 6° 18′ declination, our
    distance from the line came to be 43° 3′, the course was W.N.W.</p>

  <p>On the 24th I took the sun in 53°, it had 5° 54′ declination, our
    altitude from the pole came to 42° 54′, and our course was W.N.W., and
    we were to the right of a very large bay, to which, we gave the name of
    Bay of St. Matthew, because we found it on his day; we entered well in,
    and could not find bottom until we were entirely inside, and we found
    80 fathoms, and it has a circuit of 50 leagues, and the mouth is to the
    N.W., and it is in the altitude of 42&NoBreak;1⁄2°.</p>

  <p>On the 25th I did not take the sun, but I took it on the 26th, in
    51&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and it had 5° 7′ declination, by which we found ourselves in
    43° 27′ to the south, of the line, and the coast runs N.W. S.E. 1⁄4 N.S.</p>

  <p>On the 27th I took the sun in 50&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and it had 4&NoBreak;3⁄4° declination,
    and so our altitude came to be 44°; and here to the right hand we found
    a bay, and three leagues before it there are two rocks, and they lie
    East and West with the said bay, and further on we found another (bay),
    and there were in it many sea wolves, of which we caught eight, and on
    this land there are no people, but it is very good land, with pretty
    plains without trees, and very flat country.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, 28th, I took the sun in 48&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and it had 4° 21′
    declination, and so we found ourselves in 44° 21′, and the course was
    to the south, and at night we saw land to W.N.W.</p>

  <p>On the 29th I took the sun in 48&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and this day it had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>4°
    declination, by which we found ourselves in 45&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and the course was
    to S.S.W. and to W.S.W. and to W.N.W., and I give the whole of the run
    as to W.S.W. until I took the sun, and afterwards we were two days that
    we could not take it.</p>

  <p>On Friday, 2nd of March, I took the sun in 43° 50′, it had 3° 10′
    declination, with which our distance came to be 47°; and after that we
    did not take the sun again until we entered a port called St. Julian,
    and we entered there on the last day of March, and remained there till
    the day of St. Bartholomew, which is the 24th of August, and the said
    port is in 49&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and there we caulked the ships, and many Indians
    came there, who go covered with skins of antas, which are like camels
    without humps, and they carry some bows of canes very small like the
    Turkish, and the arrows are like theirs, and at the point they have
    a flint tip for iron, and they are very swift runners, and well made
    men, and well fashioned. We sailed thence on the 24th of the said month
    of August, and went along the coast to S.W. 1⁄4 W., a matter of 30
    leagues, and found a river called Santa Cruz, and we entered there on
    the 26th of August, and remained till the day of S. Lucas, which is the
    18th of the month of October, and there we caught much fish, and we
    took in water and wood, and this coast is well defined and with good
    marks.</p>

  <p>Thursday, the 18th of October, we sailed from the said river of Santa
    Cruz, with contrary winds, we went for two days tacking about, and then
    we had a fair wind, and went to the S.S.W. for two days, and in that
    time we took the sun in 50&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and it was on the 20th.</p>

  <p>On the 21st of the said month, I took the sun in exactly 52°, at five
    leagues from the land, and there we saw an opening like a bay, and it
    has at the entrance, on the right hand a very long spit of sand, and
    the cape which we discovered before this spit, is called the Cape of
    the Virgins, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>and the spit of sand is in 52° latitude, and 52&NoBreak;1⁄2°
    longitude, and from the spit of sand to the other part, there may be a
    matter of 5 leagues, and within this bay we found a strait which may
    be a league in width, and from this mouth to the spit you look East
    and West, and on the left hand side of the bay there is a great elbow,
    within which are many shoals, but when you enter the strait, keep to
    the North side, and when you are in the strait go to the S.W., in the
    middle of the channel, and when you are in the strait, take care of
    some shallows less than three leagues from the entrance of the straits,
    and after them you will find two islets of sand, and then you will find
    the channel open, proceed in it at your pleasure without hesitation;
    and passing this strait we found another small bay, and then we found
    another strait of the same kind as the first, and from one mouth to
    the other runs East and West, and the narrow part runs N.E. and S.W.,
    and after we had come out of the two straits or narrows, we found a
    very large bay, and we found some islands, and we anchored at one of
    them; and took the sun, and found ourselves in 52&NoBreak;1⁄3°, and thence we
    came in S.S.E. direction, and found a spit on the left hand, and from
    thence to the first mouth there will be a matter of 30 leagues; after
    that we went to S.W. a matter of 20 leagues, and there we took the sun,
    and we were in 53&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and from there we returned to N.W., a matter of
    15 leagues, and there anchored in 53° latitude. In this strait there
    are a great many elbows, and the chains of mountains are very high and
    covered with snow, with much forest. After that we went to N.W. and
    a quarter W., and in this course there are many islets; and issuing
    from this strait the coast turns to the north, and on the left hand we
    saw a cape with an island, and we gave them the name of Cape Fermoso
    and Cape Deseado, and it is in the same latitude as the Cape of the
    Virgins, which is at the beginning of the straits, and from the said
    Cape Fermoso we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>afterwards went to N.W. and to N., and to N.N.E., and
    we went in this course two days and three nights, and in the morning we
    saw land of pointed hills, and it runs North and South (thus runs the
    coast of the South sea) and from this land to Cape Fermoso there is a
    matter of 20 leagues, and we saw this land the 1st December.</p>

  <p>Now I will commence the course and latitude of this voyage after this
    land, and the 1st day of December, when we were opposite to it; it is
    in latitude 48°.</p>

  <p>December—</p>

  <p>On the 2nd of December we did not take the sun, but we went to the
    N.N.E., and were in 47&NoBreak;1⁄4°, and this day we found ourselves that much
    ahead,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> as all this country is in the same altitude.</p>

  <p>On the 6th (March), to W., in 13°. This day we saw land, and went to
    it, and there were two islands, which were not very large; and when we
    came between them, we turned to the S.W., and left one to the N.W., and
    then we saw a quantity of small sails coming to us, and they ran so,
    that they seemed to fly, and they had mat sails of a triangular shape,
    and they went both ways, for they made of the poop the prow, and of
    the prow the poop, as they wished, and they came many times to us and
    sought us to steal whatever they could; and so they stole the skiff of
    the flag-ship, and next day we recovered it; and there I took the sun,
    and one of these islands is in 12&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and the other in 13° and more
    (N. latitude); and this island of 12° is with that of Tiburones W.N.W.
    and E.S.E. (and it appears to be 20 leagues broad at the N. end), from
    the island of 12° we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>sailed on the 9th of March, in the morning, and

  <p>On the 16th (March) we saw land, and went towards it to the N.W., and
    we saw that the land trended north, and that there were many shoals
    near it, and we took another tack to the south, and we fell in with
    another small island, and there we anchored: and this was the same
    day, and this island is called Suluano, and the first one is named
    Yunuguan; and here we saw some canoes, and we went to them, and they
    fled; and this island is in 9&NoBreak;2⁄3° N. latitude and in 189° longitude
    from the meridian. To these first islands, from the archipelago of St.
    Lazarus....</p>

  <p>Ytem. From the Strait of All Saints and Cape Fermoso to these two
    islands, there will be 106° 30′ longitude, which strait is with these
    islands in a straight course W.N.W. and E.S.E., which brings you
    straight to them. From here we went on our course.</p>

  <p>Leaving these islands, we sailed W., and fell in with the island of
    Gada, which is uninhabited, and there we provided ourselves with water
    and wood. This island is very free from shoals.</p>

  <p>From here we departed and sailed W., and fell in with a large island
    called Seilani, which is inhabited, and contains gold; we coasted it,
    and went to W.S.W., to a small inhabited island called Mazaba. The
    people are very good, and there we placed a cross upon a mountain; and
    from thence they showed us three islands in the W.S.W. direction, and
    they say there is much gold there, and they showed us <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>how they gather
    it, and they found small pieces like beans and like lentils; and this
    island is in 9&NoBreak;1⁄3° N. latitude.</p>

  <p>We departed from Mazaba and went N., making for the island of Seilani,
    and afterwards coasted the said island to the N.W. as far as 10°,
    and there we saw three islets; and we went to the W., a matter of 10
    leagues, and then we fell in with two islets, and at night we stopped;
    and on the morrow we went S.W. and 1⁄4 S., a matter of 12 leagues, as
    far as 10&NoBreak;1⁄3°, and there we entered a channel between two islands, one
    called Matan, and the other Subo; and Subo, with the isle of Mazaba and
    Suluan, are E.W. 1⁄4 N.W.S.E.; and between Subo and Seilani we saw a
    very high land to the north, which is called Baibai, and they say that
    there is in it much gold and provisions, and much extent of land, that
    the end of it is not known.</p>

  <p>From Mazaba and Seilani and Subo, by the course which we came, towards
    the south part, take care; for there are many shoals, and they are very
    bad; for this a canoe would not stop which met us in this course.</p>

  <p>From the mouth of the channel of Subo and Matan we went west in
    mid-channel, and met with the town of Subu, at which we anchored, and
    made peace, and there they gave us rice and millet and flesh; and we
    remained there many days; and the king and the queen, with many people,
    became Christians of their free will.</p>

  <p>We sailed from Subu, and went S.W. till 9&NoBreak;3⁄4° between the head of Subu
    and an island called Bohol; and on the W. side of the head of Subu
    there is another, which is named Panilongo, and it belongs to black
    men; and this island and Subu contain much gold and much ginger, and it
    is in 9&NoBreak;1⁄3°, and Subu in 10&NoBreak;1⁄3°; and so we came out of the channel,
    and came ten leagues to the S., and anchored off the island of Bohol,
    and there of the three ships we made two, and burned the other, not
    having crews enough; and this island is in 9&NoBreak;1⁄2°.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>We sailed from
    Bohol to Quipit to the S.W., and came to anchor at the same anchorage
    to the right of a river; and in the offing to the N.W. part there are
    two islets, which are in 8&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and there we could not get provisions,
    for there were none, but we made peace with them; and this island of
    Quipit has much gold, ginger, and cinnamon, and so we decided on going
    to seek provisions; and from this head of Quipit to the first islands
    there will be a course of 112 leagues; it lies with them E.W. 1⁄4 N.E.
    S.W., and this island lies due East and West.</p>

  <p>From thence we sailed and went to W.S.W., and to S.W. and W., until we
    fell in with an island in which there were very few people, and it was
    named Cuagayan; and here we anchored on the N. side of it, and we asked
    where the island of Poluan was, to get provisions of rice, for there is
    much of it in that island, and they load many ships for other parts;
    and so they showed us where it was, and so we went to the W.N.W., and
    fell in with the head of the island of Poluan. Then we went to N. 1⁄4
    N.E., coasting along it until the town Saocao, and there we made peace,
    and they were Moors; and we went to another town, which is of Cafres;
    and there we bought much rice, and so we provisioned ourselves very
    well; and this coast runs N.E. S.W., and the cape of the N.E. part is
    in 9&NoBreak;1⁄3°, and the part of S.W. is in 8&NoBreak;1⁄3°; and so we returned to
    S.W. as far as the head of this island, and there we found an island,
    and near it there is a shoal, and in this course, and along Poluan,
    there are many shoals, and this head lies E.W. with Quipit, and N.W.
    S.E. 1⁄4 E.W. with Cuagayan.</p>

  <p>From Poluan we sailed for Borney, and we coasted the above-named
    island, and went to its S.W. head, and near there found an island which
    has a shoal on the E.; and in 7&NoBreak;1⁄2° we had to change the course to
    W., until running 15 leagues; after that we ran S.W., coasting the
    island of Bornei until the city itself; and you must know that it is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>necessary to go close to land, because outside there are many shoals,
    and it is necessary to go with the sounding lead in your hand, because
    it is a very vile coast, and Bornei is a large city, and has a very
    large bay, and inside it and without it there are many shoals; it is,
    therefore, necessary to have a pilot of the country. So we remained
    here several days, and began to trade, and we made good agreements of
    peace; and after that they armed many canoes to take us, which were 260
    in number, and they were coming to us, and as we saw them we sailed in
    great haste, and we went outside and we saw some junks coming, and we
    went to them, and we captured one, in which was a son of the King of
    Luzon, which is a very large island, and also the captain let him go
    without the counsel of anyone.</p>

  <p>Borney is a large island, and there is also in it cinnamon, mirabolams,
    and camphor, which is worth much in these countries; and they say
    that when they die they embalm themselves with it. Borney is in 5°
    25′ latitude—that is, the port itself—and 201° 5′ of longitude from
    the line of demarcation, and from here we sailed and returned by the
    same road; and this port of Borney lies E.N.E. W.S.W. with the isle of
    Mazaba, and in this course there are many islands; and from the cape at
    the N.E. of Bornei to Quipit is E.W. 1⁄4 N.E. S.W.</p>

  <p>We sailed from Borney, and returned by the same course which we had
    come, and so we passed between the head of the isle of Bornei and
    Poluan; and we went to the W.,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> to fall in with the isle of
    Cuagayan; and so we went by the same course to make for the island of
    Quipit on the S. side, and in this course, between Quipit and Cuagayan,
    we saw to the S. an island which they call Solo, in which there are
    many pearls, very large—they say that the king of this island has a
    pearl like an egg. This island is in 6° latitude; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>and so, going on
    this course, we fell in with three small islands; and further on we
    met with an island named Tagima, and they say there are many pearls
    there; and this island lies with Solo N.E. S.W. 1⁄4 E.W., and Tagima is
    in 6&NoBreak;5⁄6°. It is opposite the Cape of Quipit, and the said cape is in
    7&NoBreak;1⁄4°, and lies with Paluan E.S.E. W.N.W.</p>

  <p>From here we coasted the island of Quipit on the south side, and we
    went to E. 1⁄4 S.E. as far as some islets; and along the coast there
    are many villages, and there is much good cinnamon in this island, and
    we bought some of it; and there is much ginger on this coast; and so
    we went to E.N.E., until we saw a gulf; then we went to S.E. until we
    saw a large island, and thence to the cape at the east of the island of
    Quipit, and at the cape of this island there is a very large village,
    which collects much gold from a very large river, and this cape is
    191&NoBreak;1⁄2° of the meridian.</p>

  <p>We sailed from Quipit to go to Maluco, and went to S.E., sighting an
    island called Sibuco; after that we went to S.S.E., and saw another
    island, called Virano Batolague; and we went by the same course as
    far as the cape of this island, and after that we saw another, which
    they call Candicar; and we went to the E. between the two, until we
    went ahead of it; and there we entered a channel between Candicar and
    another, which they call Sarangani; and at this island we anchored and
    took a pilot for Maluco; and these two islands are in 4&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and the
    cape of Quipit in 7&NoBreak;1⁄4°, and the Cape of Sibuco, on the south side,
    is in 6°, and the Cape of Virano Batologue in 5°, and from the Cape of
    Quipit and Candicar the run is from N.N.W. to S.S.E., without touching
    any cape.</p>

  <p>We sailed from Sarangani, and went S. 1⁄4 S.E., until we came opposite
    an island called Sanguin, and between the two are many islets, and
    they are on the West side, and this island is in 3&NoBreak;2⁄3°. From Sanguin
    we went S. 1⁄4 S.E. to an island called Sian; between them there are
    many islets, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>and this island is in just 3°. From Sian we went to S 1⁄4
    S.W., as far as an island called Paginsara, it is in 1&NoBreak;1⁄6°; and from
    this island to Sarangani the run is N.S 1⁄4 N.E. S.W. in sight of all
    these islands.</p>

  <p>From Paginsara we went to S. 1⁄4 S.E., until we came between two
    islets, which lie together, N.E. and S.W., and that one to the N.E. is
    named Suar, and the other is named Atean, and one is in 1° 45′, and the
    other in 1&NoBreak;1⁄2°.</p>

  <p>From Atean we went S.S.E. until we sighted the Molucos, and then
    we went to East, and entered between Mare and Tidori, at which we
    anchored, and there we were very well received, and made very good
    arrangements for peace, and made a house on shore for trading with the
    people, and so we remained many days, until we had taken in cargo.</p>

  <p>The islands of the Malucos are these: Terrenate, Tidori, Mare, Motil,
    Maquian, Bachian, and Gilolo, these are all those which contain cloves
    and nutmeg; and there are also several others among them, the names of
    which I will mention, and in what altitude they are, and the first is
    Terrenate, which is on the side of the equinoctial line.</p>

  <p>La Talata (Lata-lata) lies north of Terrenate N.N.E. and S.S.W., and
    that which is on the equinoctial line is 190° 30′ of longitude from
    the line itself, and the island of Motil itself with Cagayan lies N.W.
    and S.E., and with Tagima, which is opposite the island of Quipit, it
    lies N.E. and S.W. 1⁄4 N.S., but in these courses one cannot venture to
    pass, for they say there are many shoals, and so we came <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>by another
    course, coasting the said islands. From the islands of Maluco we sailed
    Saturday, 21st December, of the said year 1521, and we went to the
    island of Mare, and there took in wood to burn, and the same day we
    sailed and went to S.S.W., making for Motil, and thence we went by the
    same course, making for Maquian, and thence we went to S.W., running
    by all these islands, and others, which are these:—Cuayoan, Laboan,
    Agchian, Latalata, and other small islands, which remain in the N.W.
    quarter, and now I will say in what latitude and longitude are each one
    separately, and which are those which contain cloves and other spices.
    The first to the North is Terrenate, which is in 1° North, and Tidore
    40′ and Mare 15′ and Motil on the equinoctial line, and these lie North
    and South. The others to the South are these: Maqui is in 20′ Cuayoan
    in 40′ and Laboan in 1°, and Latalata in 1° 15′ and Bachian lies with
    Terrenate E.N.E. and W.S.W.; and to the S.E. of all these islands there
    is a very large island called Gilolo, and there are cloves in it, but
    very few; therefore there are seven islands which contain cloves, and
    those which have a large quantity are these: Terrenate, Tidore, Motil,
    Maqui, and Bachian, which are the five principal ones, and some of them
    contain nutmeg and mace. Motil is on the line, and is in longitude of
    the meridian of 191° 45′</p>

  <p>From Latalata we went to S.W. 1⁄4 W., and fell in with an island
    which is called Lumutola, it is in 1&NoBreak;3⁄4°, and on the W. side there
    is another island called Sulan, and at these islands there are many
    shoals, and from hence we took the course to the South, towards an
    island named Buro, and between these three, there is another island
    which is named Fenado, it is in 2&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and Buro is in 3&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and it
    lies with Bachian N.E. and S.W. 1⁄4 N.S. in longitude 194°; and to
    the East of Buro there is a very large island called Ambon, in which
    they make much cotton cloths, and between it and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>Buro there are some
    islets; take care of them, for this it is necessary to coast the island
    of Buro to the East, and to the South of it. I took the sun in 70° 24′,
    it had 22° 36′ declination, and so the latitude came to be 3°. I was in
    the Southern part of the island, and this was on the 27th of December,
    on Friday. On the 28th of the said month, I did not take the sun, but
    we were in the neighbourhood of the said isle of Buro, and Bidia,
    which, lies to the eastward.</p>

  <p>Sunday, 29th, I took the sun in 71&NoBreak;1⁄2°, it had 22° 21′ declination,
    and our distance came to be 3° 51′, and we were opposite the isle of
    Ambon.</p>

  <p>On the 30th I took the sun in the altitude of the day before, in calm,
    it was Monday.</p>

  <p>On the 31st I did not take the sun, we were a matter of 12 leagues from
    the Isle of Ambon E.N.E. and W.S.W., the day was Tuesday.</p>

  <p>1522—</p>

  <p>The 1st day of January, 1522, I took the sun in barely 73°, it had 21°
    54′ declination, the altitude came to be 4° 45′.</p>

  <p>On the 2nd of the month, I took the sun in 73&NoBreak;3⁄4°, it had 21&NoBreak;3⁄4°
    declination, our distance came to be 5&NoBreak;1⁄2°, the course was to S.W.,
    and it was Thursday.</p>

  <p>Friday, 3rd, I did not take the sun, but the ship made the course of
    S.S.W., in latitude of 6&NoBreak;1⁄3°, after that we took the course to N.W.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of the month I did not take the sun, but we were in 5¾°, the
    course was to N.W., and the day Saturday.</p>

  <p>Sunday, the 5th, I took the sun in 75°, it had 21° 14′ declination, the
    latitude came to 6° 14′.</p>

  <p>On the 6th, Monday, I took the sun in 76°, it had 21° 2′ declination,
    the latitude came to be 7° 2′.</p>

  <p>On the 7th, I took the sun in 76&NoBreak;2⁄3°, it had 20° 50′ declination, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>the
    latitude came to be 7&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and the course was to S.W. Tuesday.</p>

  <p>On the 8th of the month, I took the sun in 77&NoBreak;1⁄2°, it had 20° 37′
    declination, and the latitude came to be 8° 7′, the course was to S.W.,
    and the day Wednesday, and this day we saw some islands, which lie
    East and West, and this day we entered between two of them, which are
    these, Lamaluco and Aliguom; between them are two little ones which
    you will leave on the right hand after entering the channel, they are
    inhabited; this channel lies N.E. S.W. 1⁄4 E.W., with Buro, and all
    these islands are ten in number, and they lie E.W. 1⁄4 N.E. S.W., and
    they have of longitude a matter of 50 leagues; we ran along them, with
    very bad weather from the South; we coasted them and anchored off the
    last, which is called Malua, which is in 8&NoBreak;1⁄3°, the others are named
    Liaman, Maumana, Cui, Aliguim, Bona, Lamaluco, Ponon, Vera. We sailed
    from Malua and went to the South, and found the island of Timor, and we
    coasted the coast from east to west, on the north side of this island,
    which is in the latitude of 9°, and the nearest land on the north
    side, and this land will have 10 leagues journey, and this coast lies
    with Buro N.E. S.W. 1⁄4 N.S., in longitude of 197° 45´, and of this
    island of Timor we coasted all the coast from east to west, as far as
    the village of Manvai; and first we came near the village of Queru,
    and from Queru to Manvai, the coast runs N.E. S.W 1⁄4 N.S., and here I
    took the sun on the 5th day of February, in 86&NoBreak;2⁄3°, and it had 12° 44′
    declination, so that the latitude came to be 9° 24′, and this island is
    very large and populous, and all the island has much sandal wood, and
    there are many towns in it.</p>

  <p>On the 8th of February I took the sun in 87&NoBreak;1⁄2°, and it had 11° 42′ of
    declination, with which our distance came to be 9&NoBreak;1⁄6°, and we were at
    the head of the island of Timor, at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>the West end, and from here to the
    Eastern cape the coast runs E.N.E. to W.S.W., and it was Saturday.</p>

  <p>Sunday, 9th of the said month, I took the sun in 88&NoBreak;1⁄6°, and it had
    11&NoBreak;1⁄3° declination. Our latitude came to be 9° 35′, and we were at the
    most salient cape of all the island, and from there it goes falling off
    to the S.W. and S.</p>

  <p>On the 10th of the same month I took the sun in 88&NoBreak;1⁄4°, it had 10° 58′
    declination; our latitude came to be 9° 28′, and the head of the island
    lay to the south, and the day was Monday.</p>

  <p>On the 11th, Tuesday, I took the sun in 88&NoBreak;1⁄4°, it had 9&NoBreak;1⁄3°
    declination; the latitude came to 9° 35′, and we were in calm.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, the 12th, I did not take the sun, but we were becalmed in
    the neighbourhood of where we were the the day before, or a little more.</p>

  <p>On the 13th I took the sun in 89&NoBreak;2⁄3°; it had 9° 52′ declination; the
    latitude came to 10° 32′, and we were in the neighbourhood of islands
    of which we do not know the names, nor whether they are inhabited. They
    lie E.S.E. and W.N.W. with the west cape of Timor, and from here we
    took our course to the Cape of Good Hope, and went to W.S.W.</p>

  <p>[After this the course was W.S.W. for several days, and there is
    nothing worthy of note till Tuesday, the 18th of March, when the
    Victoria discovered Amsterdam Island.]</p>

  <p>On the 18th of the said month (March), I took the sun in 49&NoBreak;1⁄2°, it
    had 2° 55′ declination, the latitude came to be 37° 35′, and whilst
    taking the sun we saw a very high island, and we went towards it to
    anchor, and we could not fetch it; and we struck the sails and lay to
    until next day, and the wind was W.; and we made another tack to the
    north under storm sails;&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and this was on the 19th, and we could
    not take the sun; we were east and west with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>island, and it is
    in 38°&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> to the south, and it appears that it is uninhabited, and
    it has no trees at all, and it has a circumference of a matter of six
    leagues.</p>

  <p>On the 20th of the said month, Thursday, I did not take the sun, but
    we were east and west with the island, and we went to N.W. and to
    N.N.W. and 1⁄4 N.W., and for the whole course I put down a matter of 15
    leagues to the N.N.W., and in the latitude of 35&NoBreak;1⁄2°.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd of the said month I took the sun in 50&NoBreak;1⁄4°: it had 4° 27′
    declination; the latitude came to 36° 18′. The day before we had struck
    the sails until the morning of the said Saturday, and this day we set
    sail and went to the N.W.</p>

  <div class="center">•<span class="col3">•</span>
    <span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span><span class="col3">•</span></div>

  <p>On the 8th of the said month (May) I did not take the sun; but,
    according to the run we had made, we thought we were ahead of the Cape,
    and on this day we saw land, and the coast runs N.E. and S.W. and a
    quarter east and west; and so we saw that we were behind the Cape a
    matter of 160 leagues, and opposite the river Del Infante,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> eight
    leagues distant from it in the offing; and this day we were lying to
    with winds from the west and west-north-west, and it was Thursday.</p>

  <p>On the 9th I did not take the sun, but we made land and anchored, and
    the coast was very wild, and we remained thus till next day; and the
    wind shifted to W.S.W., and upon that we set sail, and we went along
    the coast to find some port for anchoring and taking refreshments for
    the people who were most suffering, which we did not find. And we stood
    out to sea, to be at our ease; and we saw many smokes along the coast,
    and the coast was very bare, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>without any trees, and this coast
    runs N.E. and S.W.: it is in 33° latitude, and it was Saturday, 10th of
    May.</p>

  <p>Friday, the 16th (May), I took the sun in 33&NoBreak;1⁄4°; it had 21° 6′
    declination; the latitude came to 35° 39′, and we were E.S.E. and
    W.N.W., with the Cape of Good Hope twenty leagues off from it; and this
    day we sprung our fore-mast and fore-yard, and we were all day hove to,
    and the wind was W.</p>

  <p>[The <i>Victoria</i> doubled the Cape of Good Hope between the 18th
    and the 19th of May, and arrived] on the 9th of the month of July,
    and anchored in the port of Rio Grande in Santiago [of the Cape Verde
    Islands], and they received us very well, and gave us what provisions
    we wanted; and this day was Wednesday, and they reckoned this day as
    Thursday, and so I believe that we had made a mistake of a day; and
    we remained there till Sunday in the night, and we set sail for fear
    of bad weather and the difficulty of the port; and on the morrow we
    sent our boat on shore to get more rice, which we wanted, and we were
    standing off and on till it came.</p>

  <p>On the 14th of July, Monday, we sent our boat on shore for more rice,
    and it came at midday, and returned for more, and we were waiting for
    it till night, and it did not come; and we waited till next day, and
    it never came; then we went near the port to see what the matter was,
    and a boat came and told us to give ourselves up, and that they would
    send us with a ship which was coming from the Indies, and that they
    would put some of their people in our ship, and that the gentlemen had
    so ordered. We required them to send us our boat and men, and they
    said that they would bring an answer from the gentlemen; and we said
    we would take another tack, and would wait: and so we took another
    tack, and we made all sail, and went away with twenty-two men, sick and
    sound, and this was Tuesday, the 15th of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>month of July. On the
    14th I took the sun. This town is in 15° 10′.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of the said month, in the morning, we saw land, and it was
    Cape St. Vincent, and it was to the north-east of us, and so we changed
    our course to the S.E., to get away from that Cape.</p>

      <span class="xsmall">TO</span><br>
      THE SHIP “TRINITY” AND HER CREW</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadc"><i>After she parted company with the “Victoria”.<br>
    From Navarrete.</i></div>
  <hr>

  <p>After the <i>Victoria</i> left Tidore, the crew of the <i>Trinity</i>
    commenced careening their ship, and took out of her and placed
    in the store-house in Tidore their goods and the guns of the
    <i>Conception</i>, which they had burned, and of the <i>Santiago</i>,
    which was lost. Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa determined to leave in charge
    of these goods and factory the accountant, Juan de Campos, as clerk;
    the officer, Luis del Molino; the servants, Alonso de Cota, Genoese,
    and Diego Arias; and Master Pedro, a bombardier.</p>

  <p>Taking leave of the King of Tidore, the <i>Trinity</i> sailed thence
    on the 6th of April 1522, with fifty men on the muster-roll, and a
    cargo of nine hundred quintals of cloves. The <i>Trinity</i> sailed
    for forty leagues to an island named Zanufo, in 2 deg. 30 min. N.
    latitude, belonging to the King of Tidore, thence to the open sea,
    where they calculated they had two thousand leagues to run to Panama.
    In 20 deg. they fell in with an island, where they took in a native,
    and continuing a northerly course to 42 deg., they met with a storm
    which lasted five days, and they had to cut away the castle at the
    prow; their poop was broken; their mainmast was broken in two. The
    crews fell sick, and they returned to seek the island from which they
    had taken the native; but, not being able to fetch it, they arrived at
    another <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>twenty leagues distant from it. This island was named Mao,
    and is to the north of the island Botaha; they are in 12 deg. and 13
    deg. This island was three hundred leagues from the Moluccas, and they
    were a month and a half in getting there; many of the crew died. When
    they arrived and anchored at the first land, which was Zanufo, a vessel
    passed by which informed them that a fortnight after the <i>Trinity</i>
    sailed, five or seven Portuguese sail had arrived at Terrenate, whose
    captain was Antonio de Brito, and that they were building a fortress
    there. Barros states that the first stone of this was placed by
    Antonio de Brito June 24th, 1522. The captain of the <i>Trinity</i>
    begged the people of this vessel to take a man to Terrenate, who was
    Bartolome Sanchez, the clerk of the ship, by whom he sent a letter to
    the Portuguese captain, begging him, on the part of His Majesty, to
    send him succour to prevent the ship being lost, for his crew was sick
    and reduced in number. Gonzalo Gomez, seeing that this was delayed,
    weighed, and came to anchor in the port of Benaconora. Simon Abreu, and
    Duarte Roger, clerk of the King of Portugal’s factory, came there, with
    other people, in a caracora, and after that came a fusta and caravel,
    with other armed Portuguese, who entered the <i>Trinity</i>, and gave
    to the captain a letter from Antonio de Brito in answer to his, dated
    October 21st, 1522, which only said that people were going to bring in
    his ship. By an order which they brought from Antonio Brito, they at
    once took from Gonzalo Gomez all the letters, astrolabes, quadrants,
    and log-books which he had made; they took the vessel and anchored her
    in the port of Talangomi. There were seventeen Castilians of sound and
    sick in the vessel, and they took those that were well with Gonzalo
    Gomez to the fortress, and next day took the sick to the hospital.</p>

  <p>Gonzalo Gomez complained of the violence done in taking that which
    belonged to the emperor, and in his country. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>They replied that he had
    done what the emperor, his lord, had commanded him; and they, what they
    ought to do by the instructions from the king, their lord. They asked
    him to give up the royal standard of Castile, and he answered that he
    could not do so, neither could he defend it, since he was in their
    power. Upon which they drew up some documents before a notary; and
    when they discharged the cargo of the ship, he asked the Portuguese to
    give him a certificate of what was in it, for him to render an account
    to His Majesty; and they replied that, if he asked for this often,
    they would give it him on a yard arm. In the fortress we found Juan
    de Campos, Diego Arias, and Alonzo, the Genoese, sick, who were three
    of those who had remained in Tidore with the goods of His Majesty.
    They said that the Portuguese had knocked down the factory-house and
    taken the cloves and receipts for cloves which were paid for, and all
    the rigging and fittings of the ships; Luis del Molino had fled, and
    Gonzalo Gomez called him to come to the fortress under safe conduct,
    but when in it they put him in irons; Master Pedro had died.</p>

  <p>When the ship was in Tidore, the pilot, Juan Lopez Carvalho, died on
    the 14th February, 1522; and, between sailing thence and anchoring at
    Benaconora, there died in August, September, and October, thirty-one
    individuals, without counting three who ran away in the isle of Mao of
    the Ladrones.</p>

  <p>The twenty-one Castilians of the ship and factory remained about four
    months as prisoners in Terrenate, until, at the end of February 1523,
    Captain Antonio de Brito gave them a passage to India, sending them to
    the island of Banda, which was a hundred leagues off, excepting the
    carpenter Antonio, and the caulker Antonio Basazaval, whom he said
    that he required. The clerk of the factory, Juan de Campos, and three
    other Castilians, went in a junk, of which nothing was known nor what
    became of those persons. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>The Castilians remained in Banda about four
    months; from thence they were conducted to Java, and coasting it they
    arrived at a city named Agrazue. Agrazue was a town of thirty thousand
    inhabitants, Mussulmans, of great trade, to which porcelain, silks, and
    other Chinese goods were brought from Borneo and other parts.</p>

  <p>From Agrazue they went to Malacca, two hundred leagues distant, where
    Jorge de Albuquerque was captain.</p>

  <p>They were about five months at Malacca. Four Castilians died there at
    the end of November 1524. The ship-boy, Anton Moreno, remained there,
    who was, they said, the slave of a sister of Jorge de Albuquerque,
    and the rest went on to India. They were twenty-five days in reaching
    Ceylon, which was three hundred leagues, and they went a hundred
    leagues more to Cochin. The clerk, Bartolomé Sanchez, and two others,
    went in a junk, of which nothing more was heard. In Cochin they found
    that the ships for Portugal had sailed a short time before their
    arrival, and they had to wait a year for the passage of the spice ships.</p>

  <p>After they had been ten months in Cochin, without obtaining leave to
    embark, the seaman, Leon Pancaldo, and Bautista Poncero, master of the
    ship <i>Trinity</i>, fled secretly in the ship <i>Sta. Catalina</i>,
    which left them in Mozambique. There they were arrested and put on
    board the ship of Diego de Melo to be taken to the Governor of India,
    but contrary winds did not permit her departure; and, having been
    allowed to go ashore, Bautista Poncero died, and Leon Pancaldo hid
    himself in the ship of Francisco Pereira, which was going to Portugal.
    He remained hid till they got a hundred leagues from Mozambique. When
    they arrived at Lisbon they put him in prison, from which the king
    commanded him to be set free.</p>

  <p>At this time, D. Vasco da Gama arrived in India as Viceroy, and the
    Castilians begged for leave to embark in the ships which were going to
    Portugal, but he would not give <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>it. The Viceroy died in twenty days,
    and they elected in his stead D. Enrique de Meneses governor of Goa,
    who came to Cochin. Two Castilians died there, and those that remained
    had to wait for another year.</p>

  <p>Gonzalo Gomez had done homage and could not get away until after
    constant recourse and petitions to the governor, D. Enrique de Meneses,
    who gave him leave, as also to the seaman, Gines de Mafra, and to
    Master Hans, a bombardier, when it was known there that the King
    of Portugal was married to Da. Catalina, sister of His Majesty the
    Emperor. These three individuals left Cochin in the Portuguese ships,
    and when they arrived at Lisbon they put them in the Limoneiro or
    public prison, where Master Hans died. Gonzalo Gomez and Gines de Mafra
    remained there about seven months, until they were set free by letters
    from His Majesty; but Gonzalo Gomez&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> was set free twenty-seven
    days before Gines, whom they supposed to be a pilot, having found some
    log-books in his box and two other (books), which Andres de San Martin,
    pilot of His Majesty, had made, which books and other writings they
    took, and would not return to him.</p>

  <p>From their departure from Terrenate, in the Moluccas, to Lisbon,
    inclusively, there died eight individuals. What became of seven was
    unknown; two remained in the Moluccas; one in Malacca; and three
    reached Spain, besides the licentiate and priest, Morales.</p>

  <p class="p2">Gaspar Correa says (tome iii, p. 109):—</p>

  <p>“In this year 1527, one Sebastian Gabato, a Basque, and a great pilot,
    sailed from Seville as captain-major of two ships and a caravel, who
    was ordered by the Viceroy of the Antilles to go and take in cargo at
    Maluco, and recover <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>the property of the Castilians, which he might
    find belonging to the ship of the fleet of Fernan de Magalhāes which
    put in in distress; and if he found any things in the possession of the
    Portuguese, he was to ask for them and require them from the captains
    on behalf of the emperor, with all urbanity: and if they did not choose
    to give them up, he was to ask for documents, with protests, which he
    was to bring to the emperor for him to do in the matter what might be
    for his service. This fleet sailed from Seville, and never more was
    any news heard of what became of it, nor what end it had. This only
    was known, that this fleet had thus sailed this year, through other
    Castilians, who later arrived at Maluco in another fleet, as I will
    relate further on in its place.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[Correa relates, in his Tom. <span class="smcap">iii</span>, cap. xiv, that
      Charles V sent a fleet of five ships in 1527 to Maluco under
      Fray Garcia de Loaysa, and that only one ship under Captain
      Martim Inhigo reached Maluco: he then describes the disputes
      and skirmishes between the Castilians and Portuguese.]</p>

      THE MUTINY IN PORT ST. JULIAN.</h2>
  </div>
  <hr>

  <p>Navarrete gives, No. XX of his documents relating to Magellan, a
    copy of a document presented on Wednesday, the 22nd of May, 1521,
    by a servant of Diego Barbosa, on behalf of Alvaro de Mezquita,
    to the Alcalde of Seville, dated April 26th, 1520, which were the
    informations taken in Port St. Julian by Martin Mendes, clerk of the
    <i>Victoria</i>; Sancho de Heredia, king’s notary; Gonzalo Gomes de
    Spinosa, Alguazil-mayor or chief constable of the fleet: he could not
    write, and Domingo de Barruty signed for him.</p>

  <p>These informations were taken in consequence of a petition from Alvaro
    de Mezquita, captain of the <i>S. Antonio</i>, to Magellan, complaining
    of Gaspar de Quesada, captain of the <i>Conception</i>, and Juan de
    Cartagena, with about thirty armed men, having seized him the night of
    Palm Sunday, April 1st, 1520, and having locked him up in the cabin
    of Geronimo Guerra, the clerk of the <i>S. Antonio</i>. This petition
    was presented to Magellan when he was on shore, after hearing Mass on
    Sunday, the 15th of April, and he gave orders to the two clerks and
    Alguazil to make an inquiry on board the <i>S. Antonio</i>. His order
    was dated April 17th, and signed by himself and Leon de Speleta, clerk
    of the flag-ship. The informations taken on board the <i>S. Antonio</i>
    were dated Thursday, the twenty-sixth April, 1520.</p>

  <p>No. XXI of Navarrete is a letter from Juan Lopez do Recalde to the
    Bishop of Burgos, of May 12th, 1521, giving him an account of the
    arrival of the <i>S. Antonio</i> at Seville, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>6th May, 1521, commanded
    by Geronimo Guerra, a relation and servant of Christoval de Haro, and
    of the execution of Gaspar de Quesada and others. This letter relates
    the story of the mutineers and those who turned back from difficulty
    and danger, and is naturally unfavourable to Magellan.</p>

  <p>According to Navarrete, the desertion of Magellan’s fleet by the ship
    <i>S. Antonio</i>, was caused by Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese pilot,
    who, from rivalry with Magellan, and envy at seeing others promoted
    instead of himself, after the executions, got up a conspiracy on board
    the <i>S. Antonio</i>, and proposed to return to Spain. The mutineers
    put Alvaro de Mezquita in irons; they then went to the coast of Guinea,
    and thence to Spain. When the <i>S. Antonio</i> arrived at Seville,
    Alvaro de Mezquita was handed over to the authorities and kept in
    prison until the ship <i>Victoria</i> arrived. Esteban Gomez, Juan do
    Chinchilla, Geronimo Guerra, and Francisco Angulo, were also arrested;
    and Magellan’s wife and family were put under surveillance to prevent
    their going away to Portugal. According to Herrera, Juan de Cartagena
    and the priest, who were left behind, did not come away with the <i>S.
    Antonio</i>, and orders were given to send and look for them.</p>


  <p class="p2">More ample details of the suppression of the mutiny are given by Gaspar
    Correa in the following account of Magellan’s voyage, in his <i>Lendas
    da India</i> (tome <span class="smcap">ii</span>, cap. xiv):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Ferdinand Magellan went to Castile to the port of Seville, where
      he married the daughter of a man of importance, with the design of
      navigating on the sea, because he was very learned in the art of
      pilots, which is that of the sphere. The emperor kept the House of
      Commerce in Seville, with the overseers of the treasury, with great
      powers, and much seafaring traffic, and fleets for abroad. Magellan,
      bold with his knowledge, and with the readiness which he had to
      annoy the King of Portugal, spoke to the overseers of this House <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>of
      Commerce, and told them that Malacca, and Maluco, the islands in which
      cloves grew, belonged to the emperor on account of the demarcation
      drawn between them both [the Kings of Spain and Portugal]: for which
      reason the King of Portugal wrongfully possessed these lands: and that
      he would make this certain before all the doctors who might contradict
      him, and would pledge his head for it. The overseers replied to him,
      that they well knew that he was speaking truth, and that the emperor
      also knew it, but that the emperor had no navigation to that part,
      because he could not navigate through the sea within the demarcation
      of the King of Portugal. Magellan said to them: ‘If you would give me
      ships and men, I would show you navigation to those parts, without
      touching any sea or land of the King of Portugal; and if not, they
      might cut off his head.’ The overseers, much pleased at this, wrote
      it to the emperor, who answered them that he had pleasure in the
      speech, and would have much more with the deed; and that they were
      to do everything to carry out his service, and the affairs of the
      King of Portugal, which were not to be meddled with; rather than that
      everything should be lost. With this answer from the emperor, they
      spoke with Magellan, and became much more convinced by what he said,
      that he would navigate and show a course outside of the seas of the
      King of Portugal; and that if they gave him the ships he asked for, and
      men and artillery, he would fulfil what he had said, and would discover
      new lands which were in the demarcation of the emperor, from which he
      would bring gold, cloves, cinnamon, and other riches. The overseers
      hearing this, with a great desire to render so great a service to the
      emperor as the discovery of this navigation, and to make this matter
      more certain, brought together pilots and men learned in the sphere,
      to dispute upon the matter with Magellan, who gave such reasons to
      all, that they agreed with what he said, and affirmed that he was a
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>very learned man. So the overseers at once made agreements with him,
      and arrangements, and powers, and regulations, which they sent to the
      emperor, who confirmed everything, reserving specially the navigation
      of the King of Portugal; thus he commanded and prohibited, and ordered
      that everything which Magellan asked for should be given him. On this
      account, Magellan went to Burgos, where the emperor was, and kissed
      his hand, and the emperor gave him a thousand cruzados alimony for
      the expenses of his wife whilst he was on his voyage, set down in the
      rolls of Seville, and he gave him power of life and death&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> over all
      persons who went in the fleet, of which he should be captain-major,
      with regard to which he assigned him large powers. So, on his return to
      Seville, they equipped for him five small ships, such as he asked for,
      equipped and armed as he chose, with four hundred men-at-arms, and they
      were laden with the merchandise which he asked for. The overseers told
      him to give the captaincies, with regard to which he excused himself,
      saying that he was new in the country and did not know the men; and
      that they should seek out men who would be good and faithful in the
      emperor’s service, and who would rejoice to endure hardships in his
      service, and the bad life which they would have to go through in the
      voyage. The overseers were obliged to him for this, and held it to be
      good advice, and decided to inform the captains they might make, and
      the crews they might take, of the powers which he had received from
      the emperor. This they did, and they sought in Seville for trustworthy
      men for captains, who were Juan de Cartagena, Luis de Mendoça, Juan
      Serrano, Pero de Quesada. This fleet having been fitted out, and the
      crews paid for six months, he sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda in
      August of the year 1519. So he navigated to the Canary Islands, and
      took in water; whilst he was there a vessel arrived with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>letters from
      his father-in-law,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> in which he warned him to keep a good watch
      for his personal safety, because he had learned that the captains whom
      he took with him had said to their friends and relations, that if he
      annoyed them they would kill him, and would rise up against him. To
      this he replied, that he would do them no injuries so that they should
      have reason to act thus; and on that account he had not appointed them,
      but the overseers, who knew them, had given them; and whether they were
      good or bad, he would labour to do the service of the emperor, and for
      that they had offered their lives. The father-in-law showed this answer
      to the overseers, who greatly praised the good heart of Magellan.”</p>

    <p>“He sailed from the Canaries of Tanarife, and made the Cape Verde,
      whence he crossed over to the coast of Brazil, and there entered a
      river which is named Janeiro. There went, as chief pilot, a Portuguese
      named Joan Lopes Carvalhinho, who had already been in this river, and
      took with him a son whom he had gotten there of a woman of the country.
      From this place they went on sailing until they reached the Cape of
      Santa Maria, which Joan of Lisbon had discovered in the year 1514;
      thence they went to the river San Julian. While they were there taking
      in water and wood, Juan de Cartagena, who was sub-captain-major, agreed
      with the other captains to rise up, saying that Magellan had got them
      betrayed and entrapped. As they understood that Gaspar de Quesada was
      a friend of Magellan’s, Juan de Cartagena got into his boat at night,
      with twenty men, and went to the ship of Gaspar Quesada, and went in to
      speak to him, and took him prisoner,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>a relation of his
      captain of the ship, in order that all three might go at once to board
      Magellan and kill him, and after that they would reduce the other ship
      of Joan Serrano, and would take the money and goods, which they would
      hide, and would return to the emperor, and would tell him that Magellan
      had got them entrapped and deceived, having broken faith with his
      instructions, since he was navigating in seas and countries of the King
      of Portugal: for which deed they would get first a safe conduct from
      the emperor. So they arranged matters for their treason, which turned
      out ill for them.”</p>

    <p>“Magellan had some suspicion of this matter, and before this should
      happen, he sent his skiff to the ships to tell the captains that the
      masters were to arrange their ships for beaching them to careen them;
      and with this pretext he warned a servant of his to notice what the
      captains answered. When this skiff came to the revolted ships they
      did not let it come alongside, saying that they would not execute any
      orders except those of Juan de Cartagena, who was their captain-major.
      The skiff having returned with this answer, Magellan spoke to Ambrosio
      Fernandes,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> his chief constable, a valiant man, and gave him orders
      what he was to do, and to go secretly armed; and he sent a letter to
      Luis de Mendoça by him, with six men in the skiff, whom the chief
      constable selected. And the current set towards the ships, and Magellan
      ordered his master to bend a long hawser,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> with which he might drop
      down to the ships if it suited him. All being thus arranged, the skiff
      went, and coming alongside of Luiz de Mendoça, they would not let him
      come on board. So the chief constable said to the captain that it was
      weakness not to bid him enter, as he was one man alone who was bringing
      a letter. Upon which the captain bade him enter. He came on board, and
      giving him the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>letter, took him in his arms, shouting: ‘On behalf of
      the emperor, you are arrested!’ At this the men of the skiff came on
      board with their swords drawn; then the chief constable cut the throat
      of Luis de Mendoça with a dagger, for he held him thrown down under
      him, for so Magellan had given him orders. Upon this a tumult arose,
      and Magellan hearing it, ordered the hawser to be paid out, and with
      his ship dropped down upon the other ships, with his men under arms,
      and the artillery in readiness. On reaching the ship of Mendoça, he
      ordered six men to be hung at the yard-arms, who had risen up against
      the chief constable, and these were seized upon by the sailors of the
      ship, of which he at once made captain, Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese,
      and a friend of his: and he ordered the corpse of Mendoça to be hung
      up by the feet, that they might see him from the other ships. He then
      ordered Barbosa to prepare the men for going and boarding one of the
      other ships; and to avoid doing the harm which it was in its power to
      have done, and since he was a Portuguese, and the crews belonged to the
      emperor, he used a stratagem, and spoke secretly to a sailor, whom he
      trusted, who fled to the ship of Cartagena, where, at night when the
      current set for Magellan’s ship, which was astern, the sailor seeing
      his opportunity, cut the cable or loosed the ship of Cartagena, so that
      it drifted upon that of Magellan, who came up, shouting: ‘Treason!
      treason!’ Upon which he entered the ship of Cartagena, and took him and
      his men prisoners, and made captain of the ship one Alvaro de Mesquita,
      whom Cartagena had arrested and put in irons, because he found fault
      with him for the mutiny which he was making. Seeing this, the other
      ship at once surrendered. He ordered Cartagena to be quartered, having
      him publicly cried as a traitor; and the body of Luis de Mendoça also
      was quartered; and he ordered the quarters and the executed men to be
      set on shore, spitted on poles. So the Castilians had great fear of
      him, for he kept the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>mutineers prisoners in irons, and set to the
      pumps, during three months that he remained in this river, in which he
      careened and refitted his ships very well.”</p>

    <p>“When he was about to set sail, he ordered the prisoners to be set at
      liberty, and pardoned them, and he sent them to go along the shore,
      following the bank of the river until they found the headland from
      which they could see the sea on the other side; and whoever returned
      to him with this news he would give him a hundred ducats as a reward
      for good news. These men went for more than forty leagues, and returned
      without news; and they brought back two men, fifteen spans high, from a
      village which they found. He then sent Serrano, because his vessel was
      the smallest, to go along the river to discover its extremity; and he
      went with a strong current, which carried him without wind. And, going
      along thus, his ship grounded on some rocks, on which it was lost, and
      the boat returned laden with the crew. Magellan sent the boats thither,
      and they saved everything, so that only the hull was lost. Then he
      ordered two priests, who had taken part in the mutiny, to be set on
      shore, and a brother of Cartagena, whom he pardoned at the petition of
      Mesquita, and he left them thus banished.”</p>

    <p>“Then he sailed from the river and ran along the coast until he reached
      a river, to which they gave the name of Victoria, and which had high
      land on either side. From this river Mesquita’s ship ran away, and it
      was not known whether they had killed him, or if he had gone of his own
      accord; but an astrologer and diviner told him that the captain was a
      prisoner, and that they were returning to Castile, but that the emperor
      would do them an injury.”</p>

    <p>“Then Magellan, with the three ships which he had, entered the river,
      through which he ran for more than a hundred leagues, and came out on
      the other side into the open sea, where he had a stern wind from the
      east, with which they ran for more than five months without lowering
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>their sails, and they fetched some uninhabited islands, in one of
      which they found some savages, who lived in huts underground. They went
      to another island where they gave them gold for its weight of iron, by
      which means they collected much gold: the people also were of a good
      disposition, and had a king. They were well governed people, who were
      at war with other neighbours who were more powerful than themselves;
      for which reason the king became Christian, with all his people, in
      order that Magellan might assist him against his enemies. This Magellan
      offered to do, and with his armed men, and the people of the country,
      he went against the enemy, of whom he killed many, and burned a
      village. The enemy got assistance from others, and many came to fight
      with Magellan, who defeated them, and the struggle was a severe one.
      They acted with cunning, for they had placed ambuscades of men hidden
      in the bush, who, seeing the Castilians wearied, came out against them
      and killed many, and another ambuscade came out of the bush to seize
      the boats, which were on the beach without men: then the king came out,
      and fought with them, and defended the boats, and brought off the men.”</p>

    <p>“The king who had fled, seeing himself defeated, plotted treachery
      with the Christian king, and made an agreement with him to give him
      his daughter in marriage, and plighted his troth to him, that when he
      died, for he was already old, all would remain to him, and they would
      always live as friends; because the Castilians would depart, and if he
      did not act thus he would always make war on him: and this was with the
      condition that he was to find him means for killing the Castilians. And
      the Christian king, like a brutal man, consented to the treachery, and
      prepared a great feast and banquet for carrying it out, to which he
      invited Magellan, who went to the banquet with thirty men, of the most
      honourable and well dressed: while they were enjoying themselves at the
      banquet, the armed enemies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>entered, and killed Magellan, and all the
      Castilians, and none of them escaped, and they stripped Serrano, and
      dragging him along, brought him to the beach, where they executed him,
      and killed him thrown down on the ground.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>”</p>

    <p>“Those who were in the ships, seeing the misfortune on shore, which
      the sailors who had gone in the boats related to them, raised up from
      among them as captain, Carvalhinho, the pilot of the flag-ship, whom
      all obeyed. He ordered one of the ships, which was very leaky, to be
      stripped, and set fire to it in the midst of the sea, so that the
      people on shore should not profit by the iron, and he made captain of
      the ship of Serrano one Gonzalo Gomez d’Espinosa, who was a relation of
      the astrologer,&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> who also died with Magellan, and did not divine
      the evil which befel him.”</p>

    <p>“The two ships departed thence, running between many islands, and they
      went to one which had much very fine cinnamon. From this place they
      went running through many islands to the island of Borneo, where they
      found in the port many merchant junks from all the parts of Malacca,
      which made frequent visits to Borneo. Here Carvalhinho sent a present
      to the king of scarlet cloth, and coloured silks, and other things,
      with which the king was much pleased, and he did him great honour, and
      gave him leave and safe conduct to remain on shore for twenty days, for
      such was their custom to give to new people, the first time that they
      came to their port, in which they could buy and sell freely as much as
      they pleased. But the king, knowing how much goods the ships contained,
      got up a plot to kill them, and take the ships. This treachery was
      concerted by the king with the Javanese who were in the port in large
      junks; and for this object the king showed great honour to those who
      went on shore, and sent refreshments to the ships, and leave <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>to remain
      in the port as long as they pleased. Carvalhinho became suspicious
      at this, and ordered good watch to be kept day and night, and did
      not allow more than one or two men to go ashore. The king perceiving
      this sent to beg Carvalhinho to send him his son who had brought the
      present, because his little children who had seen him, were crying
      to see him. He sent him, very well dressed, with four men, who, on
      arriving where the king was, were ordered by him to be arrested. When
      Carvalhinho knew this he raised his moorings, and with armed men went
      to board a junk which was filled with many people and ready to sail.
      They entered this junk and plundered much gold and rich stuffs, and
      captured a son of the King of Luzon, who was captain of the junk and of
      three others which were in the port, and who had come in them to marry
      a daughter of this King of Borneo. They found in this junk valuable
      things of gold and jewellery which he had brought for his wedding; and
      they found there three girls of extreme beauty, whom Carvalhinho took
      care of, saying that he would take them to the emperor: at which all
      rejoiced. But he did not act thus, but slept with them, so that the
      Castilians were near killing him; but he divided with the Castilians so
      liberally that they became friends; for he agreed with the bridegroom,
      that he and his people should escape by night, and for that should
      give him much wealth of precious stones, and by night they got away by
      swimming; and Carvalhinho pretended to have been asleep, and woke up
      complaining of the watch. But the Castilians understood the deceit, and
      took Carvalhinho and put him in irons, and took from him all he had,
      and raised up as captain one Juan Bautista, master of the ship, because
      he understood pilot’s work.&NoBreak;<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>”</p>

    <p>“Thence they sailed and went to Maluco, Ternate, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>Tidore, where
      they took to the kings the presents which Magellan had set apart for
      them. They paid them great honour, and received them hospitably,
      for they also gave to their ministers; and to the kings they gave
      an embassage on the part of the emperor, relating to them his
      magnificence, so that both soon obeyed him, and did homage as vassals
      for ever; and they established trade and prices for buying and selling,
      and established factories on shore, and began to collect cloves, and
      very much was brought to them, because the Castilians gave what they
      asked, for they had a superfluity of merchandise; thus they became
      lords of the land. As the ships were much injured, they patched them
      up a little, the best they could, and hastened to fill both ships with
      cargo, which they did in one month. When they were about to sail there
      came to the Castilians a Portuguese, named Juan de la Rosa, who had
      come to Ternate, saying he was a pilot, and would take them to Castile,
      upon which they agreed with him to give him fifty quintals of cloves in
      each ship, because he said he would take them to the island of Banda,
      which had more riches than Maluco. So the Castilians rejoiced greatly
      at taking this man back to the emperor, for the greater certainty as
      to their discovery. This Juan de la Rosa warned the Castilians that
      they would come from India and seek for them, and kill them all, for
      this was spoken of in India. To this the Castilians gave much credit,
      and on that account did him great honour. They settled with the King
      of Tidore to leave with him a factor with the merchandise, which they
      had, because many ships would soon come, sent by the emperor; for which
      reason they should have much cloves collected together. They then set
      sail, making de la Rosa captain of the ship of Carvalhinho.”</p>

    <p>“When they were at sea they freed him from his irons, from the need
      they felt for his navigation, and they went to the island of Banda,
      where they restored to Carvalhinho <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>his captaincy, and they went to
      Banda, where they took samples of nutmeg and mace, as they had nowhere
      to take in cargo of it. All having been consulted, they set sail to
      make for the Cape of Good Hope, and navigate thence to Castile, for
      they did not dare take any other course. Setting sail with this design,
      they met with hard weather, with which the ship of Carvalhinho put into
      port, and that of la Rosa continued her course. Carvalhinho put into
      Maluco, where he discharged half the ship’s cargo, and heeled her over,
      and repaired her as well as possible; this he did in twenty days, and
      again set to taking in cargo and departing; but he fell ill with the
      labour, and died on setting sail. They made Gonzalo Gomez d’Espinosa
      captain of the ship again, and he, by the instructions of Carvalhinho,
      took a course to search for the river (strait) through which they had
      come; but when at sea, the ship again took in so much water, that they
      ran before the wind to beach her on the first land they made, which
      was in Batochina, where they beached the ship, and saved from her no
      great quantity of goods. Whilst they were at this juncture D. Gracia
      Anriques arrived at Maluco, with a ship to take in cloves, which came
      from Malaca, and learning how these Castilians were there he sent to
      call them under his safe conduct, that they should all come, because if
      they did not he would hold them as enemies, and would go at once and
      fetch them. The Castilians therefore, constrained by fortune, went to
      where D. Gracia was, like as men who were lost, so that D. Gracia had
      compassion upon them, and gave them a good reception, and supplied them
      with necessaries, and having laden his ship, he embarked them all with
      him, and they were more than thirty, and he took them to Malaca, where
      Jorge d’Albuquerque was captain, who ordered the factor to give them
      provisions for their maintenance, and in the monsoon to send them to
      India, where D. Duarte [de Meneses] was governor. He commanded <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>those
      who chose to be written down in the rolls for pay, and he forbade
      the ships of the kingdom to take them, that they might not return to
      Castile; and in fact all died, only Gonzalo Gomes d’Espinosa passed to
      Portugal in the year 1525, and he was made a prisoner in Lisbon, and
      set at liberty by a letter which the empress sent to the king.”</p>

    <p>“The other ship followed its course, so that la Rosa made the Cape of
      Good Hope, and while she was going near the land Pero Coresma, who was
      going to India in a small ship, met her, and spoke her; and he was told
      she belonged to the emperor, and came from Maluco, and it did not come
      into his understanding to send her to the bottom, that she might not
      return to Castile, and the ship entered the watering place of Saldanha,
      and thence fetched Cape Verde, where they went ashore to get wood and
      water; there some Portuguese, learning that the ship came from Maluco,
      took the boat when it came ashore, with twenty Castilians; and as
      there was no ship in the port they got into a boat to go and capture
      the ship; but the ship seeing the boat come with armed men, for the
      arms glittered, weighed and set sail for Cape St. Vincent, and thence
      entered San Lucar with thirteen men, for now there were no more, and it
      arrived in the year 1521. From Cape Verde they wrote to the king about
      the Castilians, who remained there; the king ordered that they should
      let them go till they died, but never to allow them to embark for any
      port; and so it was done.”</p>

    de se seruir de douos uasalos seuos homens de pouca sustancia seruindo
    se uosalteza de muitos dos naturaes de castela alegando outras muitas

    desiderando veder del mondo nelli anni passati, ho navicato cum le

    dove nascono le specie nelle nove Indie, nel qual viazo ho circumdato
    tutto il mondo à torno et per esser cosa, che mai homo lha fatta, ho
    composto un libreto de tutto el ditto viazo, qual desidero far stampir.
    Et per ho suplico de gratia che per anni xx alcun non possi stampirlo,
    salvo chi voro io, sotto pena à chi el stampasse, o stampato altrove
    el portasse qui, oltra e<sup>l</sup> perder li libri de esser condenato lire tre

      of Philip I, Da. Leonor, in Villa do Crato, 24th November, 1518. The

      cause of Magellan’s being disgusted with the King of Portugal; some

      this despatch, “a hundred reis, more or less”.</div>

      going out of it on the 24th of August, they wintered there for the

      passage may be found in a passage of Castanheda, lib. 6, cap. 13, which

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> Amoretti, the editor of Pigafetta, observes, that whilst
      the fleet was in the river of Santa Cruz, between 50 deg. and 40 deg.
      South latitude, there was, on the 11th of October, an eclipse of the
      Sun, “<i>which</i> (he says) <i>the Portuguese and Spanish writers
      mention, and which is registered in the astronomical tables</i>:” and
      he judges it to be an error of Castanheda putting this phenomenon on
      the 17th of April, and his attributing to Magellan the calculation of
      longitude of which he speaks. Barros also mentions an eclipse of the
      sun in April. It is noteworthy that neither our pilot’s narrative nor
      Pigafetta mentions a phenomenon which still in those times did not
      happen without causing some impression on men’s minds, or at least
      without exciting public curiosity. <i>Lisbon Ac. note.</i>

      <p>I am indebted to the courtesy of the Astronomer Royal, Mr. G. B. Airy,
        for the following information, which confirms Castanheda and Barros:
        “1520, April 17. There was certainly (from our own calculations) a
        total solar eclipse about 1.20 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Greenwich time. But in the
        Art de verifier les dates, in which the extreme Southern eclipses are
        not included, none is mentioned for April 17: consequently the eclipse
        was a Southern eclipse, crossing the South Atlantic.”</p>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> This is the famous strait which till this day is named
      the Strait of Magellan, for the eternal and glorious memory of the
      famous Portuguese who discovered it. Castanheda says that Magellan, on
      account of arriving there on the 1st of November, gave it the name of
      All Saints’ bay, and in the answer which André de S. Martin gave to the
      inquiries made to him about that navigation, he also names the channel
      that of All Saints’ (Barros, Dec. 3, liv. 5, cap. 9). The anonymous
      Portuguese, the companion of Duarte Barbosa, whom we have quoted above,
      and who sailed in the “Victoria,” says that at first the navigators
      called it the Strait of the Victoria, because that ship was the first
      which sighted it. (Ramusio, 3rd edition, tom. i. page 370). <i>Lisbon
      Ac. note.</i></div>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> Alvaro de Mesquita, a Portuguese, and cousin of Magellan,
      was captain of this ship which went to explore the passages of the
      Straits, and did not return, and its pilot was Estevan Gomes, also a
      Portuguese. This Estevan Gomes had been requesting the Emperor Charles
      V. to confide to him a few caravels to go and discover new lands; but
      as the proposal and enterprise of Mazellan then interposed itself,
      and was preferred and accepted, Estevan Gomes continued after that to
      be a great enemy of the illustrious captain, and now profited by the
      opportunity to revenge himself on him, and to give vent to his rabid
      envy. He conspired, therefore, with others against the captain of his
      ship, Alvaro de Mesquita; they put him in irons, and brought him thus
      to Spain with the ship, telling the Emperor <i>that Magellan was crazy,
      and had lied to His Majesty, because he did not know where Banda was,
      nor Maluco</i>. Besides this, they brought accusations against Mesquita
      of having counselled and persuaded Magellan to use the severity and
      cruelty with which he punished the first conspirators, etc. (V. the
      Letter of Transylvanus and Castanheda, liv. 6, cap. 8). <i>Lisbon Ac.
      note.</i></div>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> The ships <i>S. Antonio</i> and <i>Conception</i> were
      sent on this exploration of the Straits; they were with difficulty
      able to double the Cape Possession, named thus in Bougainville’s map,
      and in others. They at length entered a narrow opening, which in the
      maps is named the first gut, and they proceeded thence to another bay,
      which is named Boucant bay, or Boucam. At the end of this they entered
      into another strait, named the second gut, and having passed that, they
      came out into another bay larger than the former ones. Then, seeing
      that the strait was prolonged and offered an outlet to the ships, they
      returned with the good news to Magellan, who was waiting for them,
      and on seeing him, they fired off all their artillery and shouted for
      joy. The fleet then sailed together as far as the third bay, and as
      they found two channels, Magellan despatched the two vessels, <i>S.
      Antonio</i> and <i>Conception</i>, to examine whether the channel,
      which took the S.W. direction, would issue into the Pacific sea. Here
      it was that the ship <i>S. Antonio</i> deserted, going ahead of its
      companion for that purpose. The other two ships, <i>Victoria</i> and
      <i>Trinity</i>, meanwhile entered the third channel, where they waited
      four days for the explorers. During this interval, Magellan despatched
      a well equipped boat to discover the cape with which the strait ought
      to terminate: this having been sighted, and the boat returning with
      the news, all shed tears of consolation, and they gave to this cape
      the name of Cape Desire; it is that which is at the outlet of the
      strait on the South side. They then turned back to seek for the ships
      <i>Conception</i> and <i>S. Antonio</i>, and leaving marks by which
      this one might steer, in case of its having lost the way (for they were
      still ignorant of its desertion), they sailed forward until they came
      out into the Pacific Ocean. <i>Lisbon Ac. note.</i></div>

      Sunday of Lent, which is named of Lazarus. Now, these islands are named

      here mentioned. Some of our writers have said, or conjectured, that
      Duarte Barbosa was killed by poison; but this is a mistake. The
      barbarians, indeed, drew the Castilians ashore under the pretext of
      giving them a banquet, but it does not follow from that that they
      poisoned them. The Transylvan says: <i>inter epulandum, ab iis, qui in
      insidiis collocati fuerant, opprimuntur. Fit clamor undique: nuntiatur
      protinus in navibus nostros occisos.</i> See Barros, 3, 5, 10. The
      other captain, who was John Serrano, was not killed, but remained alive
      in the hands of the barbarians at the time the boats made off, because,
      notwithstanding the most mournful supplications which he made from the
      shore for rescue, Joan Lopes de Carvalho feared further treachery, and
      ordered the anchor to be weighed. <i>Lisbon Ac. note.</i></div>

      any writer of the times near that of Pigafetta who have treated of
      the astrolabe, such as Regiomontanus, Appianus, Gimma Frisius, Danti,
      Clavius, etc.; but from what our author says here and elsewhere, it
      appears that the mediclino is that movable rule, fixed on the centre of
      the astrolabe, which turns round it, and is named sometimes albidade,
      or dioptron, or traguardo, or linea di fiducia. Note, Milan edition.</div>

    <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_432" href="#FNanchor_432" class="label">[432]</a> Amoretti, in his introduction to this Treatise of
      Navigation, in the Milan edition, observes that Pigafetta was misled
      by a false theory when he supposes that there is in the heavens a
      point in repose to which the magnetic needle tends, but that the exact
      direction of the magnetic needle coincided, or at least approximated,
      to the meridian of the isle of Ferro, which is not now the case; and
      that in some other places the variations of the compass had been
      observed to correspond with that of the longitude. By the table of
      variations of the compass published by Lambert in the Ephemerides of
      Berlin (<i>Astronomische Jahrbuch</i>) for the year 1779, it is seen
      by an easy calculation that at the beginning of the sixteenth century
      the magnetic equator or zero of deviation was very near the isle of
      Tenerife. Now it is further off, and the distance increases. M. de
      Bougainville found there the deviation to the west to be 14 deg. 41
      min.; and Staunton, the companion of Lord Macartney, found it to be 17
      deg. 35 min.</div>

      but Maximilian and his translators appear to have thought that
      <i>feralis</i> is derived from <i>fera</i>. Ramusion translates: “Dando
      loro a mangiar carne di fiere;” and the Spanish version in Navarrete
      has: “Con su aparato y cerimonias bestiales.” Ducange has an adverb,
      <i>feraliter</i>, with the sense of beastly.</div>

      <i>S. Antonio</i>, a prisoner; but what Correa relates may have been
      part of the plot and a stratagem of Juan de Carthagena.
